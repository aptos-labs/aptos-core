/// THE ORIGIN OF THE DOGESHIP
///
/// [Sidenote: [600-713 A.D.]]
///
/// There are but few records of the period between the stipulation of the
/// compromise with the emperor Maurice to the foundation of the Venetian
/// dukedom, but they suffice to confirm the autonomous policy enjoyed by
/// the Venetian islands at that time. The majority of these records refer
/// to the wars engaged in by the Venetians with the Lombards. By these they
/// became masters of Padua. At the time of King Agilulf they turned their
/// arms against the islands to get them under their own sway. The increasing
/// prosperity of the islands, and the idea that the wealth accumulated
/// there had been mostly imported from the continent to protect it from
/// the usurpation of conquerors, kindled a strong desire to complete its
/// conquest. The external dangers of the islands were attended by the
/// internal disputes from the ambitions and jealousies of the tribunes.
///
/// An imminent invasion of the Lombards was feared when the greater part
/// of the country, recognising the gravity of the danger menacing them,
/// summoned a general council to Heraclea under the presidency of the chief
/// patriarch Aristoforo. And here it was unanimously agreed to introduce
/// a stricter form of government by preventing the rivalries of the
/// magistrates who were the chief fomenters of the internal dissensions.
/// And following the example of great cities like Rome, Genoa, and Naples,
/// which were saved by dukes, they agreed to appoint a chief magistrate with
/// jurisdiction over all the islands with the title of "duke" (_doge_).
/// Then, proceeding to the election of the person on whom this dignity
/// was to be conferred, their choice fell upon Paolu Lucio, or Paoluccio
/// Anafesto. Such was the origin of the Venetian dukedom as it is recorded
/// by chroniclers. But if there is unity among them as to the causes which
/// gave rise to the ducal power in maritime Venetia, there is none with
/// regard to the time in which it was instituted. Some put it in the year
/// 697, others relegate it to the first years of the next century. Among
/// them there is Giovanni Diacono,[h] who puts the election of Paoluccio
/// at the time of Anastasius II, emperor, and of Liutprand king of the
/// Lombards. And as, according to the most ancient Venetian chronicler,
/// Liutprand succeeded to the throne in 712 and Anastasius in 713, the
/// election of Paoluccio could not have been before the latter year.
///
/// [Sidenote: [713-900 A.D.]]
///
/// Therefore between the two extreme dates quoted by the chroniclers there
/// is a difference of sixteen years, sufficient time to afford material for
/// criticism. But the different points were defended and contested without
/// result. Muratiri Leo defended the date of 697, which is the date given
/// by Dandolo and his followers; Romanin oscillated between the two dates;
/// Filiasi and Balbo were inclined to the medium course and put the election
/// of Paoluccio in the year 706 or 707. But as neither the one nor the
/// other adduces more authentic proofs in support of the closer date, we
/// will remain firm in preferring that of 713, which is according to the
/// most eminent author on Venetian matters. We are the more led to this
/// preference by the cause to which the chroniclers generally attribute the
/// foundation of Venetian dukedom. For if it is true that the imminence of
/// the Lombards led the inhabitants of the islands to institute a supreme
/// magistrate, it could not have referred to the time preceding Liutprand
/// in which the Lombards, either through flaccidness of purpose or through
/// internal disputes, were incapable of thinking of new conquests or
/// exercising fears or apprehensions among their neighbours. The chronicler
/// Giovanni says nothing of the attributes of the new magistrate, and his
/// silence on such an important subject is the more deplorable, as in the
/// computations made by posterior chroniclers on the ducal authority we find
/// names used of matters more contemporaneous to them than to the time of
/// which they speak.
///
/// Andrea Dandolo,[g] the most authentic among them, describes in the
/// following words the attributes of the first Venetian dukes: "They
/// had," says the doge chronicler, "the power and right to convoke the
/// general meeting for public affairs, to appoint tribunes and judges to
/// administer all matters private, lay, and ecclesiastical, save the mere
/// spiritual; they had power in everything befitting the title of duke;
/// and by their orders there the councils of the clergy took place and the
/// election to the prelature was made by the clergy and the people, the
/// election and the investiture being from their hands, as they had the
/// power of appointment." It is very doubtful whether the ducal attributes
/// were originally so defined in detail. Anyhow, from the appearance of a
/// military magistrate with the title of master of the militia alongside of
/// the first duke, it can be inferred that the jurisdiction of the duke was
/// limited to civil affairs. For the chronicler Giovanni,[h] in speaking of
/// Paoluccio Anafesto, says that he judged his own with temperate justice.
/// And here the verb to judge is used in a more definite and proper sense
/// than in that used by the Lombard histories and documents respecting their
/// dukes. It expresses that which is solely civil jurisdiction, whilst the
/// jurisdiction of the Lombard dukes included the military jurisdiction as
/// well as the civil.
///
/// We have an important document of the dogedom of Anafesto,[i] which shows
/// how beneficial the institution of the ducal power was to the Venetians.
/// This document is a convention of the doge with Liutprand, by which the
/// Lombard king conceded to the Venetians the trade of the territories of
/// the kingdom proper, and, defining the limits between the two states,
/// it declared to be Venetian the territories between the Piave Major
/// and the Piavicelli on the side of Heraclea. Such, according to the
/// chronicler Giovanni, was the tenor of the treaty of peace concluded
/// between Liutprand and the first doge of Venice. And we have authentic
/// confirmation of its truth in its verification, made by Barbarossa in the
/// year 1177, of that which pertained to the designation of the Venetian
/// confines on the part of Italy.[c]
///
/// It was in 809 [or 810], in a war against Pepin, son of Charlemagne, that
/// the Venetians made choice of the Island of the Rialto, near which they
/// assembled their fleet bearing their wealth, and built the city of Venice,
/// the capital of their republic. Twenty years afterward they transported
/// thither from Alexandria the body of St. Mark, the evangelist, their
/// chosen patron. His lion figured in their arms, and his name in their
/// language whenever they would designate with peculiar affection their
/// country or government.

/// VENICE IN THE TENTH CENTURY
///
/// [Sidenote: [900-996 A.D.]]
///
/// While the Venetians disputed with the Lombards, the Frank and the
/// German emperors, the little land on which stood their houses, they had
/// also to dispute the sea that bathed them, with the Slavonians, who had
/// established themselves for the purpose of piracy on the eastern side of
/// the Adriatic.[b] It was hardly five hundred years since the fugitives
/// from Padua and Aquileia had sought refuge in the lagunes. Content with
/// having found safety there and freedom to enlarge their town and extend
/// their commerce, they had hitherto only made just wars, having only taken
/// to arms to repulse pirates, help oppressed neighbours, or to defend their
/// liberty against Pepin and the Hungarians.
///
/// Although many victories had given them a just appreciation of their
/// strength, they had no aggression to reproach themselves with, unless
/// perhaps that against the Saracens, but this war was undertaken at the
/// solicitation of the Italian people, and on the request of the Eastern
/// emperor. Moreover, in generally received ideas of this epoch, the
/// Saracens, in their quality as infidels, were beyond the pale of common
/// rights. The republic had never made incursions on the continent, for it
/// would not be just to lay to its account the short expeditions of the two
/// doges, who had no other object than their own interests.
///
/// [Illustration: A DOGE OF VENICE]
///
/// This union of exiles and fishers had become a rich, powerful, warlike,
/// yet at the same time a peaceful nation. The fruit of this moderation had
/// been if not an existence exempt from trouble, at least a medium to the
/// creation of an independent state, freeing itself little by little from
/// the influence of the two empires between which it found itself--a state,
/// moreover, which treated with its neighbours, counted many illustrious
/// families, whose princes married kings' daughters, yet in its entity did
/// not extend beyond the lagunes and several points of the neighbouring
/// coast. A new scene was to open up.
///
/// Commerce, that profession in which fortunes are continually being tried,
/// is not a school of moderation. Successes inspire greediness and jealousy,
/// and these latter the spirit of domination. Maritime commerce wanted ports
/// where her ships could be gathered, authority where she bought, privileges
/// where she sold, safety for navigation, and, above all, no rivals. This
/// ambitious spirit is really the same as that of conquest. Venice will show
/// us an example of it.
///
/// No choice of the Venetians was more justified by its great and lasting
/// results than that of Doge Pietro Orseolo II in 991. He was the son of
/// him who had abdicated the dogate fifteen years before. As in the life of
/// all great men there is something of the marvellous, it was spread abroad
/// that his father had announced that his son would be the glory of his
/// country, and the holiness of Orseolo I gave to these paternal hopes all
/// the authority of a prophecy.
///
/// Hardly was the new doge on the throne, than the factions which had torn
/// Venice during the reign of his feeble predecessor calmed down or at any
/// rate were quiet. Deliberations had been frequently troubled ones; the
/// palace had more than once been stained with blood. Orseolo made a law by
/// which all acts of violence in the public assembly should be punished
/// by a fine of twenty gold livres or the death of those who had not the
/// wherewithal to pay. A statesman as well as a clever warrior, he occupied
/// himself with forwarding commercial prosperity. He treated with all the
/// Italian states for goods. He obtained from the emperor of the East that
/// all subjects of the republic should be exempt from dues throughout the
/// empire, not only in ports but inland, or at least that the dues should be
/// reduced in the proportion of thirty gold sols to two. Finally he assured
/// himself, by an embassy and presents, of the favour of Egyptian and Syrian
/// sultans. The interior commerce of the Adriatic was itself an abundant
/// source of riches for the Venetians. Favoured by concessions from the
/// patriarch of Aquileia and the Italian kings, their ships went the whole
/// length of Lombardy and Friuli to sell all sorts of foreign wares. They
/// were welcome in the ports of Apulia and Calabria; on the eastern coast of
/// the gulf they enjoyed some privileges, bought, it is true, by a tribute,
/// but which were none the less profitable.
///
/// They got from Dalmatia firewood, wines, oils, hemp, linen, all kinds of
/// grain and cattle. The eastern coast offered lead, mercury, and metals of
/// every kind, wood for building, wools, cloth, house linen, cordage, dried
/// fruits, and even slaves and eunuchs. Everywhere they possessed themselves
/// of the exclusive commerce in salt and salted fish, and carried into
/// every country the merchandise of the East. It was owing to a so extended
/// commerce that Venice, until then without territory, armed fleets, and
/// placed between two empires, knew how to resist one and make herself
/// necessary to the other. These advantages were considerable, but to enjoy
/// them peaceably it was necessary to be delivered from these Narentine
/// pirates, who for one hundred and fifty years annoyed Venetian commerce
/// with their continual inroads. They furnished no immediate cause for
/// attack, only demanded the annual tribute which the republic had promised
/// them, to which the doge answered that he would soon bring it himself.
/// Their attacks were at that time directed against the peoples established
/// the length of the Adriatic; the Istrians, Liburnians, and the Dalmatians.
///
/// [Sidenote: [996-997 A.D.]]
///
/// Various nations had established themselves one after another on these
/// coasts; at first they depended on their chiefs for protection; then those
/// in Dalmatia came under the sway of the Eastern emperor, while those
/// farther north looked to the ruler of the West. These two empires became
/// feeble; various commercial towns sprang up on the sea coast which came by
/// little and little to regard themselves as independent, and these would
/// have found an assured source of prosperity in maritime pursuits were it
/// not for the interference of the neighbouring Narentines. It would not be
/// unreasonable to conjecture that Venice was not without some anxiety, even
/// jealousy, with regard to these people settled on the east coast of the
/// Adriatic, for they were independent, industrious, and good sailors.
///
/// Venetian historians relate that all these people, as if moved
/// unanimously, sent deputies to Venice to implore help against the pirates,
/// offering to give themselves to the republic if she would deliver them.
/// There are very few people who will give themselves away, and there are no
/// magistrates who have the right of giving away people. This deputation, if
/// it be true that it took place, did more honour to the politics of those
/// who received it than to the wisdom of those who sent it. However that may
/// be, the Venetians hastened to collect a considerable armament to go and
/// help, or overthrow, their neighbours, and the doge, after having received
/// from the bishop's hands the standard of the republic, went to sea in the
/// spring of the year 997.[d]
///
/// [Sidenote: [997-998 A.D.]]
///
/// It was on the 18th of May, 997, that the fleet left its moorings, and
/// pointed its prows toward Grado, where it was met by the patriarch Vitali
/// Sanudo, followed by a solemn procession of the clergy and the people.
/// From Grado the whole armament sailed successively to Pirano, Omago,
/// Emonia, Parenzo, Rovigno, Pola, Zara, Spalatro, Trau, Ossero, Arbo,
/// Veglia, Sebenigo, Belgrado, Lenigrado, and Curzola. All those places
/// appeared to welcome the Venetians as their deliverers, and each readily
/// took an oath of allegiance to its suzerain. At Zara, where the merchants
/// of Venice had formed their earliest settlements, and where the people
/// exhibited peculiar fervour, Orseolo spent six days; and during that
/// period arrived a deputation from Dircislaus, king of Croatia, whose alarm
/// at the successful progress of the expedition rendered him desirous of
/// conciliating the republic. The ambassadors of Dircislaus were dismissed
/// without an audience. At Trau, he found the brother of the king, Cresimir
/// by name, who implored his Serenity to aid him in establishing a joint
/// claim to the throne of his father, from which he stated that he had been
/// recently driven by the perfidy of Dircislaus. Orseolo entertained the
/// matter favourably, and even consented shortly afterward (998), as a mark
/// of his friendship and esteem, as well as on grounds of commercial policy,
/// to the union of his own daughter, Hicela, with the son of the Croatian
/// prince.
///
/// But the campaign was far from being at a close. A great impediment was
/// still to be conquered. Lesina, the principal member of the Illyrican
/// group, and the chief resort of the pirates, still remained untaken;
/// and the doge, having sent ten galleys from Trau to ravage the coast of
/// Narenta, hastened with the main squadron to accomplish that object.
/// Orseolo entered the harbour without hesitation; and the usual summons to
/// surrender having produced no effect, an order was given to commence the
/// assault. The Lesinese shrank in dismay from the tempest of stones and
/// darts which poured without cessation over their walls; the escarpment
/// was scaled; a tower was invested and taken; the Venetians entered the
/// town; and, after a brief interval of license and confusion, the arrival
/// of the doge restored order. The judicious clemency of Orseolo conciliated
/// the esteem of the vanquished; and such was the powerful effect which the
/// reduction of a place, generally thought to be unassailable, produced on
/// its neighbours that, so soon as she heard of the fall of Lesina, the
/// little republic of Ragusa despatched an embassy to offer her allegiance
/// to the conqueror. At the same time, the ten galleys which had undertaken
/// to lay waste the coast of Narenta, rejoined the main squadron with
/// forty Croatian prizes; and this collateral success, which might be
/// partly instrumental in humiliating King Dircislaus, afforded no slight
/// satisfaction to Orseolo. Having thus, in the course of a few months,
/// completed the object of his expedition, the doge concluded the campaign
/// by dictating terms to the sea-robbers of Narenta; and Orseolo, having
/// returned to the capital, and communicated to the national Arrengo the
/// wonderful success which had attended the arms of the republic, was
/// proclaimed Doge of Venice and Dalmatia (998). The assumption of this
/// lofty appellation seems to have been entirely in harmony with the notions
/// of sovereignty generally prevalent at that epoch. The incomplete conquest
/// and precarious tenure of a few hundred miles of the Dalmatian seaboard
/// sufficed, in the eyes of the Venetians, to constitute Dalmatia itself
/// into an integral portion of their dominions; and it is a circumstance
/// strikingly characteristic of the age, that, in conferring new honours
/// upon the crown, no attempt was made to discriminate between an immense
/// tract of country in which the republic had little or no territorial
/// interest and over a small portion only of which she exercised the barest
/// of feudal rights, and the islands, to which she enjoyed the fullest
/// prescriptive and possessory title.[4][k]
///
/// [Sidenote: [998-1198 A.D.]]
///
/// In the intervals of peace Orseolo nobly employed his fortune raising
/// public monuments. His father had founded a hospital and rebuilt at his
/// own expense the palace and church of St. Mark. The son had the cathedral
/// of Grado rebuilt, others say the whole city, and many buildings in
/// Heraclea. This magnificence may give an idea to what degree of splendour
/// the great families had arrived. This particular one had only been raised
/// to ducal dignity one generation.[d]
///
/// It would have been to expect from the illustrious citizens of Venice
/// more than one could expect from the human race to ask them to forget the
/// glory and splendour of their house, to raise themselves above domestic
/// interests, to work only for the grandeur of the state, and make this
/// generation consist in the equality of all the citizens. The tendency
/// towards aristocracy was for a long time only the result of influence
/// given by riches, office, the remembrance of service rendered, and
/// the respect which attaches itself naturally to an illustrious name.
/// This kind of aristocracy existed long before the legal one. In the
/// political order there was no distinction between nobles and plebeians,
/// and when a foreigner, or a prince even, was admitted to the quality of
/// Venetian, they said to him, "_Civem nostrum creamus_"--"We make you our
/// fellow-citizen."
///
/// But the Venetian nobles had frequented the society of high French barons,
/// and naturally took some of their opinions. On their side the people and
/// the middle class, like the nobles, were also interested. If the very
/// legitimate pride of the aristocrats made them desire power, the good
/// sense of the other party advised them to claim a share. It was from the
/// struggle between these interests that a new form of government arose. One

/// [Sidenote: [1198-1202 A.D.]]

/// The settlement of the Venetian constitution prepared the republic for

/// her subsequent prosperity than the religious wars of the Europeans for
/// the recovery of the Holy Land from the Mohammedan infidels.
///
/// From the epoch of the Peace of Constance to the end of the twelfth
/// century, the history of Venice is occupied by no occurrence which
/// deserves to be recorded. But the first years of the thirteenth
/// century are the most brilliant and glorious in the long annals of the
/// republic. They are filled with the details of a romantic and memorable
/// enterprise--the equipment of a prodigious naval armament, the fearless
/// pursuit of a distant and gigantic adventure, the conquest of an ancient
/// empire, the division of the spoil, and the consummation of commercial
/// grandeur.
///
/// In the year 1198, Pope Innocent III, by the preaching of Fulk Neuilly,
/// a French priest, had stirred up the greatest nobles of that kingdom to
/// undertake a crusade for the deliverance of the Holy Sepulchre. Baldwin,
/// count of Flanders, enrolled himself in the same cause, and Boniface,
/// marquis of Montferrat, accepted the command of the confederates. They
/// were warned by the sad experience of former crusades not to attempt the
/// passage to Asia by land; and the maritime states of Italy were the only
/// powers which could furnish shipping for the transport of a numerous army.
/// The barons therefore sent a deputation to Venice to entreat the alliance
/// and negotiate for the assistance of the republic (1201 A.D.).
///
/// Henry Dandolo, who, at the extraordinary age of ninety-three, and
/// in almost total blindness, still preserved the vigorous talents and
/// heroism of youth, had been for nine years doge of Venice. He received
/// the illustrious ambassadors with distinction; and after the object of
/// their mission had been regularly laid before the councils of the state,
/// announced to them in the name of the republic the conditions upon which
/// a treaty would be concluded. As the aristocracy had not yet perfected
/// the entire exclusion of the people from a voice in public affairs, the
/// magnitude of the business demanded the solemn assent of the citizens,
/// and a general assembly was convened in the square of St. Mark. There,
/// before the multitude of more than ten thousand persons, the proud nobles
/// of France threw themselves upon their knees to implore the assistance of
/// the commercial republicans in redeeming the sepulchre of Christ. Their
/// tears and eloquence prevailed. The terms of alliance had been left to
/// the dictation of the doge and his counsellors; and for 85,000 marks of
/// silver, less than $200,000 ($1,000,000), and not an unreasonable demand,
/// the republic engaged to transport 4,500 knights with their horses and
/// arms, 9,000 esquires, and 20,000 infantry, to any part of the coasts of
/// the East which the service of God might require, to provision them for
/// nine months, and to escort and aid them with a fleet of fifty galleys;
/// but with the farther conditions that the money should be paid before
/// embarkation, and that whatever conquests might be made, should be equally
/// shared between the barons and the republic.
///
/// The Venetians demanded a year of preparation; and before that period had
/// expired, both their fidelity to the engagement and the extent of their
/// resources were conspicuously displayed. But all the crusaders were not
/// equally true to their faith; many whose ardour had cooled, shamefully
/// deserted their vows; others had taken ship for Palestine in Flanders,
/// at Marseilles, and at other Mediterranean ports; and when the army had
/// mustered at Venice, their numbers fell very short of expectation, and
/// they were utterly unable to defray the stipulated cost of the enterprise.
/// Though their noble leaders made a generous sacrifice of their valuables,
/// above 30,000 marks were yet wanted to complete the full payment; and the
/// republic, with true mercantile caution, refused to permit the sailing
/// of the fleet until the amount of the deficiency should have been lodged
/// in their treasury. The timid and the lukewarm already rejoiced that the
/// crusade must be abandoned, when Dandolo suggested an equivalent for the
/// remainder of the debt, by the condition that payment should be deferred
/// if the barons would assist the republic in reducing the city of Zara,
/// which had again revolted, before they pursued the ulterior objects of
/// their voyage.
///
/// The citizens of Zara had committed themselves to the sovereignty of
/// the king of Hungary, and the pope forbade the crusaders to attack the
/// Christian subjects of a monarch who had himself assumed the cross. But
/// the desire of honourably discharging their obligations prevailed with
/// the French barons over the fear of papal displeasure, and, after some
/// scruples, the army embarked for Zara (1202 A.D.). The aged doge having
/// obtained permission from the republic to take the cross and lead the
/// fleet, many of the citizens followed his example in ranging themselves
/// under the sacred banner, and the veteran hero sailed with the expedition
/// of nearly five hundred vessels, the most magnificent armament, perhaps,
/// which had ever covered the bosom of the Adriatic. Though Zara was deemed
/// in that age one of the strongest cities in the world, the inhabitants
/// were terrified or compelled into a surrender after a siege of only five
/// days: their lives were spared, but their houses were pillaged, and their
/// defences razed to the ground.

/// The talents and heroism of the venerable Dandolo had won for the doges
/// of Venice the splendid and accurate title of dukes of three-eighths of
/// the Roman Empire; he died at Constantinople almost immediately after the
/// Latin conquest, full of years and glory; and bequeathed to the republic
/// the difficult office of governing a greater extent of dominion than
/// had ever fallen to the inhabitants of a single city. All the islands
/// of the Ionian, and most of those in the Aegean seas, great part of the
/// shores of continental Greece, many of the ports in the Propontis, or
/// Sea of Marmora, the city of Adrianople, and one-fourth of the eastern
/// capital itself were all embraced in her allotment, and the large and
/// valuable island of Candia was added to her possessions by purchase
/// from the marquis of Montferrat to whom it had been assigned. But the
/// prudence of her senate awakened Venice to a just sense of her own want
/// of intrinsic strength to preserve these immense dependencies; and it
/// was wisely resolved to retain under the public government of the state
/// only the colony at Constantinople, with the island of Candia and those
/// in the Ionian Sea. The subjects of the republic were not required to
/// imitate the forbearance of the senate, and many of the great Venetian
/// families were encouraged, or at least permitted, to found principalities
/// among the ruins of the Eastern Empire, with a reservation of feudal
/// allegiance to their country. In this manner most of the islands of the
/// Aegean Archipelago were granted in fief to ten noble houses of Venice, and
/// continued for several centuries subject to their insular princes.[o]
///
/// It was by slow and artfully disguised encroachments that the nobility
/// of Venice succeeded in substituting itself for the civic power, and
/// investing itself with the sovereignty of the republic. During the
/// earlier period, the doge was an elective prince, the limit of whose
/// power was vested in assemblies of the people. It was not till 1032
/// that he was obliged to consult only a council, formed from amongst the
/// most illustrious citizens, whom he designated.[5] Thence came the name
/// given them of _pregadi_ (invited). The grand council was not formed
/// till 1172, 140 years later, and was from that time the real sovereign
/// of the republic. It was composed of 480 members, named annually on the
/// last day of September by twelve tribunes, or grand electors, of whom
/// two were chosen by each of the six sections of the republic. No more
/// than four members from one family could be named. The same counsellors
/// might be re-elected each year. As it is in the spirit of a corporation
/// to tend always towards an aristocracy, the same persons were habitually
/// re-elected, and when they died their children took their places. The
/// grand council, neither assuming to itself nor granting to the doge the
/// judicial power, gave the first example of the creation of a body of
/// judges, numerous, independent, and irremovable; such, nearly, as was
/// afterwards the parliament of Paris. In 1179, it created the criminal
/// _quarantia_; called, also, the _vecchia quarantia_, to distinguish it

/// Genoese, in their turn attacked Sardinia, in the year 1015; but completed
/// the conquest only in 1050. They established colonies there, and divided
/// it into fiefs between the most illustrious families of Pisa and Genoa.
/// They also conquered the Balearic Isles from the Saracens, between the
/// years 1114 and 1116.[e] The Pisan fleet of three hundred sail, commanded
/// by the archbishop Pietro Moriconi, attacked the Balearic Isles, where as
/// many as twenty thousand Christians were said to be held captive by the
/// Moslems, and returned loaded with spoil and with a multitude of Christian
/// and Moslem prisoners. The former were set at liberty or ransomed, and
/// among the latter was the last descendant of the reigning dynasty.
/// The chief eunuch, who had governed Majorca, perished in the siege.
/// Immediately afterwards the fourteen years' war with Genoa broke out. The
/// two republics contested the dominion of the sea, and both claimed supreme
/// power over the islands of Corsica and Sardinia. A papal edict awarding
/// the supremacy of Corsica to the Pisan church proved sufficient cause for
/// the war, which went on from 1118 to 1132. Then Innocent II transferred
/// the supremacy over part of Corsica to the Genoese church, and compensated
/// Pisa by grants in Sardinia and elsewhere. Accordingly, to gratify the
/// pope and the emperor Lothair II, the Pisans entered the Neapolitan
/// territory to combat the Normans. They aided in the vigorous defence of
/// the city of Naples, and twice attacked and pillaged Amalfi, in 1135 and
/// 1137, with such effect that the town never regained its prosperity. It
/// has been said that the copy of the _Pandects_ then taken by the Pisans
/// from Amalfi was the first known to them, but in fact they were already
/// acquainted with those laws. The war with Genoa never came to a real end.
/// Even after the retaking of Jerusalem by the Moslems (1187), the Pisans
/// and Genoese again met in conflict in the East, and performed many deeds
/// of valour. They were always ready to come to blows, and gave still more
/// signal proofs of their enmity during the Sicilian war in behalf of the
/// emperor Henry VI. There could be no lasting peace between these rival
/// powers until the one or the other should be crushed.[l]
///
/// When, towards the end of the eleventh century, the western world took up
/// the dispute with the Saracens for the sepulchre of Jesus Christ, Venice,
/// Pisa, and Genoa had already reached a high point of commercial power;
/// these three cities had more vessels on the Mediterranean than the whole
/// of Christendom besides. They seconded the crusaders with enthusiasm. They
/// provisioned them when arrived off the coast of Syria, and kept up their
/// communication with the West. The Venetians assert that they sent a fleet
/// of two hundred vessels, in the year 1099, to second the First Crusade.
/// The Pisans affirm that their archbishop Daimbert, who was afterwards
/// patriarch of Jerusalem, passed into the East with one hundred and twenty
/// vessels. The Genoese claim only twenty-eight galleys and six vessels;
/// but all concurred with equal zeal in the conquest of the Holy Land; and
/// the three maritime republics obtained important privileges, which they
/// preserved as long as the kingdom of Jerusalem lasted.[e]
