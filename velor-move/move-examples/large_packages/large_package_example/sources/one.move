/// Not a long winded text that goes on and on and on
/// THE DARK AGE
///
/// It has been observed again and again that the sweep of history is a
/// continuous stream, and that all attempts to divide it into epochs are
/// more or less arbitrary. Nevertheless, one cannot escape the tendency
/// to classify, and memory is greatly aided by such arbitrary divisions.
/// The largest and perhaps the most uniformly accepted of such arbitrary
/// parcelling out of history is the classification into ancient, medieval,
/// and modern. Everyone is aware that the general historian usually regards
/// ancient history as closing either with the later decades of the fourth
/// century, when the northern barbarians began their invasions, or, perhaps
/// more generally, with the precise date 476, when the last emperor of old
/// Rome was dethroned. The ensuing epoch, comprising a period of about a
/// thousand years, is known as the medieval period; which epoch is usually
/// considered as closing with the discovery of the New World in 1492. The
/// earlier centuries of this epoch are usually spoken of as constituting the
/// dark age.
///
/// Such a division is arbitrary, but not altogether illogical. It has been
/// urged that Rome itself did not know it had fallen in the year 476;
/// and that the Roman Empire--even the Roman Republic, in the phrasing
/// of the time--went on, as the minds of contemporaries conceived it,
/// uninterruptedly for many centuries after the date which we of later time
/// fix for the quietus of Roman imperial life. But few things are better
/// established than the fact that a clear conception of history demands
/// a certain opportunity for the observation of events in perspective.
/// In other words a contemporary judgment is rarely, if ever, the best
/// judgment regarding any epoch. In the multiplicity of details that are
/// thrust necessarily upon the attention of the contemporary observer,
/// large proportions are lost, and a confused mass of little things makes
/// the picture as unintelligible as is the large canvas of the painter
/// when viewed at too short a focus. With the historical view, as with
/// the painting, one must recede to a certain distance before gaining a
/// measurably true conception. And so looking back through the vista of
/// centuries one is able to observe very clearly that the time of the
/// alleged fall of the Western Roman Empire was a time of real crisis in the
/// sweep of historical events. The erection of the one focal date is, to
/// be sure, a quite unjustifiable marking of boundary lines, unless it be
/// regarded in the same way in which one thinks of the parallels of latitude
/// and longitude on the globe. It is a convenient milestone, nothing more.
/// But the epoch which it marks, if not to be limited to the confines of a
/// single year, is none the less a true epoch; as no one can doubt who will
/// consider the history of Rome in the aggregate during the first, second,
/// and third centuries of the Christian era, and then will consider the
/// history of the same city during the fifth, sixth, and seventh centuries.
/// Obviously, a vast change has come over the spirit of civilisation in this
/// time; the later centuries, contrasted with the earlier ones, may well be
/// considered a dark age.
///
/// We have already shown that during its period the eastern division of
/// the later Roman Empire was the seat of a culture which found expression
/// in the production of an elaborate literature. But the West during
/// this period was under quite different auspices. Rome had ceased to be
/// important as a centre of civilisation; its chief citizens had removed to
/// the city of Constantinople. Here in the West the half-civilised Herulians
/// and Ostrogoths held almost undisputed sway from 476 till about the middle
/// of the sixth century. Then for a century the Eastern Empire reasserted
/// control over Rome and the legions of Narses and Longinus upheld the
/// authority of the Byzantine emperors. But in 568 the Lombards under Alboin
/// swept down into Italy and their supremacy was hardly disputed until the
/// Carlovingians took a hand in Italian affairs, with the result that in 774
/// Charlemagne, capturing Desiderius in Pavia, assumed the title of king of
/// the Lombards and virtually ended the Lombard kingdom.
///
/// In 781 Charlemagne crowned his son Pepin king of Italy, and in the
/// memorable year 800 Charlemagne was himself crowned emperor of the West,
/// reviving the title and a semblance of the glory of the old Imperium.
/// Charlemagne's successors retained nominal control over the empire, and
/// disputed with the popes the real control of Italy. This warfare between
/// the papal monarch and the emperors was a salient feature of the later
/// centuries of the epoch. The power of the church had increased slowly and
/// insidiously until in the ninth and tenth centuries the bishop of Rome
/// aspired to real kingship over Italy,--even over the entire empire.
///
/// The five hundred years of Italian history outlined in this period
/// contrast strangely (as has been said) in their world historical meaning
/// with the half millennium of empire that preceded it, or with the other
/// half millennium within which were comprised the events of the Roman
/// commonwealth. Those earlier periods, as we glance back over them in
/// perspective, bristle with great events; whereas this later epoch shows
/// a bare plane of mediocrity, if not of decline. Yet we must not think
/// of these later centuries as representing a time of relapse into actual
/// barbarism. It was rather an epoch when the decadent civilisation was
/// struggling against complete overthrow on the one hand, while the
/// new civilisation was striving to make itself felt,--striving as yet
/// ineffectually as regards the higher culture, yet none the less preparing
/// the way for the future germination of a new life in the old empire.
///
/// There is no more fascinating effort open to the historian than to glance
/// back through the mists of the centuries and attempt to penetrate the
/// gloom of this dark age, and visualise its social conditions. At best
/// such an attempt at reconstructing the distant past can be but partially
/// successful. If it be true that "we view the world through our own eyes,
/// each of us, and make from within us the things we see," as Thackeray
/// tells us regarding our contemporary environment, vastly more distorted
/// must our image be of any past events. Where the monuments, art treasures,
/// and the literature of a great civilisation have been preserved to us,
/// as in the case of Egypt and Mesopotamia, and Greece, and Rome, we have
/// aids and accessories for the reconstruction of the picture that enable
/// us to view our rehabilitation with a certain confidence. But where
/// these mementoes of the past are lost or altogether lacking, the picture
/// must, indeed, be a vague and uncertain one,--the foggy tracery of the
/// impressionist as contrasted with the firm outlines of a Michelangelo.
///
/// And such are the disadvantages that beset the task of reconstructing the
/// image of Italy, or indeed of any other part of Europe, in the so-called
/// dark age. It was a time when the wealth of the later empire had been
/// transferred to the East. Western Europe was poverty-stricken; and this
/// practical fact, perhaps more than any other one cause, operated to
/// prevent the construction of such monuments of architecture and of art
/// as the earlier centuries achieved. We have seen illustrated again and
/// again that the seat of the greatest civilisation is almost sure to be
/// the commercial and monetary centre of the world; and we shall see the
/// same thing illustrated again with renewed force at a later day in Italy,
/// when the gold of the Florentine tradesmen, the Medici, stimulates the
/// art development of the later Renaissance. But in these post-imperial
/// times Italy has no wealth in commerce, as compared with the new centre
/// of the empire in Constantinople. Such Romans as remain in Italy are too
/// poor to build palaces and amphitheatres comparable to those of their
/// predecessors. They have enough to do to guard themselves against the
/// invaders from the north. At best they can hardly repair the structures
/// that the earlier civilisation has left them. We read that in Venice
/// it was at one time made a legal offence, punishable with a fine of
/// one thousand florins, to suggest any draft on the public treasury for
/// repairing state buildings. According to the familiar tradition, the doge
/// who finally had the temerity to violate the restriction, came before the
/// council with the thousand florins in his hand when making the suggestion.
/// This story illustrates the financial stress under which the Italian
/// cities laboured even at a comparatively late period of the Middle Ages.
///
/// But it would be a very great mistake to suppose that the lapse in the
/// material civilisation which undoubtedly took place in the later day of
/// imperial Rome coincided with an entire change in the social conditions
/// of the people. No trait in human nature is more fixed and more insistent
/// than the tendency to cling to the ways of our forbears. Conservatism is
/// the dominant motive of the mass of humanity. What our fathers thought
/// and believed, we for the most part think and believe. The average man
/// inherits his religion and his politics much as he inherits the colour
/// of his eyes; and has scarcely more likelihood of changing one than the
/// other. In the sweep of the centuries, ideas and customs do change, to
/// be sure; but the changes, in so far as they pertain to long-standing
/// principles or customs, are always slow and gradual.
///
/// Geologists of the nineteenth century demonstrated, after long study and
/// much argument, that there are no cataclysmic vaults in the sweep of the
/// geological and biological ages. The lesson thus taught regarding nature
/// at large is one which the sociologist might apply to his own would-be
/// science with advantage. In particular this lesson should be called to
/// the attention of the student of history who would have us believe that
/// there was a sudden and catastrophic change in the mentality of the people
/// of Italy in the fifth century A.D. No one who appreciates the true
/// character of human progress will be disposed to believe, in the absence
/// of confirmatory evidence, that the Italian of the sixth century differed
/// very greatly in his desires and aspirations from his grandparent who
/// lived while Rome was yet nominally governed by an Italian emperor. The
/// successive hordes of barbarians that swept down from the north took booty
/// wherever they could find it, and impoverished the country, but for the
/// most part they were not imbued with the spirit of wanton destruction. We
/// may well believe that they looked rather with awestruck admiration akin
/// to reverence upon the wonderful monuments of a civilisation so different
/// from anything they had previously witnessed. We know that relatively
/// civilised nations of the north sacked Rome in the sixteenth century more
/// disastrously than it was sacked by their alleged barbaric precursors of
/// the earlier millennium. Moreover, these invaders from the north were not
/// omnipresent. They came and went at relatively long intervals, and there
/// were some territories that they did not greatly molest. And the history
/// of invasions everywhere goes to show that after the moment of initial
/// conquest the barbaric vanquisher becomes, in matters of custom and
/// thought, a follower rather than a leader of the vanquished.
///
/// In the present case there can be no doubt that this rule held true. The
/// nations of the north were gifted with potentialities that were rapidly
/// developed through imitation of the southern civilisation. Long before
/// the so-called dark ages ended, there began to be centres of civilisation
/// in the north, and here and there a man of real genius--a Roger Bacon or
/// an Abelard--appeared to prove the rapid forward sweep of the culture
/// movement, since the highest genius never towers far above the culture
/// level of its time. But this could not have come to pass if the invader
/// from the north had entered Italy as an all-devastating eliminator of
/// previous civilisations. He came to conquer, but he remained to learn the
/// arts of civilisation.
///
/// In a word, then, we shall gain a truer picture of the state of Italy
/// in the so-called dark age if we think of it as differing not so
/// greatly in the ideals of its material civilisation from the Italy of
/// the Roman Empire. There is no great architecture, no great art, no
/// great literature; but we cannot believe that there were absolutely no
/// aspirations towards these antique ideals. When we recall how much that
/// was known to be produced in the earlier day has been utterly lost, we
/// need not doubt that there were some productions even in the field of
/// literature, of which we now have no knowledge, that we would gladly
/// reclaim from oblivion. The _cacoethes scribendi_ is too dominant an
/// impulse to be quite absent from any generation; surely, human nature
/// did not change so utterly in the dark age as to rout this impulse from
/// the human mind. What chiefly did occur, apparently, was the direction
/// of the literary impulse into an unfortunate channel--the channel of
/// ecclesiasticism. This carried it to a maelstrom from which the would-be
/// producer of literature was not able to disengage himself for many
/// generations. A startling evidence of this is found in the fact that as
/// Robinson[1] points out, there was no literary layman of renown from
/// Boetius (d. 524 or 525 A.D.) to Dante (1265-1321 A.D.).
///
/// Let us think, then, of the dark age as a time when Italy was
/// impoverished; a time when its material civilisation retrogressed; a time
/// when the stress of new conditions thrust some of the old ideals into the
/// background; but also as a time when the mixture of races was taking place
/// that was to give new strength and fibre to a senescent people; and to
/// make possible the resuscitation of the old ideals, the rehabilitation of
/// the old material civilisation, the regeneration of the race.
///
///
/// THE ELEVENTH AND TWELFTH CENTURIES
///
/// The regeneration is not to be effected, however, for some time to come.
/// The 11th and the 12th centuries are at best to see only the dawning of
/// the new day.
///
/// Culture of the creative kind is still in abeyance in Italy; there are
/// still no writers of significance; there is little art except as practised
/// in the illumination of manuscripts, and as foreshadowed in the beginnings
/// of architecture. Nevertheless, there is a germative culture. Here and
/// there a knight brings back a book from the East--for this is the age of
/// the Crusades. Here and there a monk pores over a classic manuscript.
/// Virgil was read and copied all through the dark age, as we know from the
/// incontestable evidence of extant manuscripts. There is no manuscript of
/// Horace in the uncial writing of the early centuries, yet he too must have
/// been read in the West, along with all the other Latin classics that have
/// come down to us, else these works would scarcely have been preserved;
/// for the Greek authors alone found favour in the East. Still it is to be
/// feared that the chief interest felt by many of the monks in the old-time
/// manuscripts was directed towards the material on which they were written
/// rather than towards the text itself. Hagiology often took the place of
/// history and many an ancient manuscript has been partially preserved in
/// palympsest, merely because a monk who wished to write the life of a saint
/// was too careless to complete the erasure of the earlier writing.
///
/// Contemplating the monastic life, through which it is often asserted the
/// germs of learning were preserved in the western world in this dark age,
/// one receives an impression of racial stasis which does not really accord
/// with the facts. If the monks were the preservers of the feeble torch of
/// learning, it was the wandering and warring hosts of the outside world
/// who were preparing their generation to receive the new light when it
/// should again burst forth. The Scandinavian and German hosts from the
/// north invaded Italy _en masse_, from time to time, as we have seen, and
/// successive bands of crusaders made Italy their highway when journeying
/// to and from the East. Many of these invaders found the southern clime
/// congenial and took up their permanent abode there. Thus the Normans
/// established a kingdom in Italy, and if the other hosts settled as
/// individuals rather than as nations, their influence must have been none
/// the less potent in bringing about that mixture of racial elements which
/// makes for racial progress.
///
/// Equally important must have been the influence of the commercial spirit.
/// The conquest of the Normans took from the Greek cities of southern Italy,
/// Amalfi, Naples, and Gaeta, the commercial supremacy they had previously
/// enjoyed. They were now superseded by Pisa, Genoa, and Venice. These
/// cities kept fleets on the sea in constant contact with the East. As might
/// have been expected, they led other Italian cities in power and influence,
/// and were the first to show intimations of that quickening of life which
/// presaged the new birth.
///
///
/// THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY
///
/// The first half of the thirteenth century furnishes additional chapters in
/// the old story of the fight between emperor and pope. Frederick II, the
/// present incumbent of the imperial throne, is one of the most picturesque
/// characters of the Middle Ages. He is a man of extraordinary versatility;
/// master of many languages, including Greek and Arabic, patron of the arts,
/// himself a poet, and what perhaps is most remarkable of all, considering
/// his scholarly proclivities, an advocate of the use of the vernacular
/// out of which is developing a new Italian language. Frederick is far too
/// broad and versatile a man to be confined within the narrow boundaries
/// of the church; hence his life is made up of a series of wrangles with
/// the popes. Yet he upholds the religious liberties of his subjects in
/// Sicily; he prosecutes a successful crusade, and restores the influence
/// of the western world in Jerusalem. He is under ban of excommunication
/// when he undertakes this crusade, and now he is again denounced for having
/// undertaken it. He rebels against the papal antagonism, and declares that
/// he will wear his crown and uphold its authority despite ecclesiastical
/// interference. We have seen like threats pronounced before, and have seen
/// such an emperor as Henry IV fail to make good his menace. But Frederick
/// adopts a novel plan which for a time proves expedient; he colonises
/// Luceria with a population of Saracens, which can furnish him a band of
/// thirty thousand infidel warriors to whom papal authority means nothing.
/// Notwithstanding this aid, however, he is barely able to hold his own
/// against the pope in the long run, and he dies just at the middle of the
/// century, worn out in middle life by endless warrings.
///
/// During the ensuing half century Italy is little troubled by the emperors;
/// papal authority is at its height, but a disunited Italy consumes its
/// strength in internal dissensions. The developing civilisation has
/// gradually focalised more and more towards the north and now its centre
/// has come to be Tuscany,--the same geographical location which furnished
/// the pre-Roman civilisation of the Etruscans. Florence is coming to be
/// the chief city of Tuscany; it is the chief centre also of one of the
/// most persistent and disastrous strifes that are convulsing Italy,--the
/// warfare of the Guelf and Ghibellines. This dissension is in no sense
/// confined to Florence, to be sure; it includes all Italy and even extends
/// beyond the national bounds. The factions war with varying success. In
/// 1260 the Guelfs at Florence meet with a signal reverse at the battle
/// of Monteaperto. But eight years later at Theliacozza, the Ghibellines
/// under Conradin, the last of the Hohenstaufens, receive a most disastrous
/// set-back.
///
/// An important feature of the epoch is the steady development of the half
/// dozen cities; in particular the rivalry between the three chief maritime
/// cities, Venice, Pisa, and Genoa. Pisa has more than held her own until
/// now, but in 1284 she receives her quietus in the duel with Genoa off the
/// isle of Meloria; henceforth, she must yield supremacy to her conqueror
/// and to Venice.
///
/// But, as has been said, the maritime cities no longer hold uncontested
/// supremacy. Florence, "The Flower of Tuscany," though lacking the
/// advantage of geographical position, is able, nevertheless, to take a
/// place among the commercial centres; thanks to her location on the highway
/// between Germany and southern Italy, she perhaps profits more by that all
/// essential mingling of the races to which reference has been made, than
/// any of her sister cities. Just at the close of the century the warfare of
/// the Guelfs and Ghibellines receives a new development in Florence through
/// the strife of the factions that come to be known as the Bianchi and Neri;
/// the dispute which began as a mere personal strife spreads its baneful
/// influence over the entire community.
///
/// Notwithstanding all these dissensions, however, there is marked progress
/// in civilisation during this century. The Italian cities can boast that
/// their streets are paved, while the streets of Paris, the foremost city
/// of the north, are mere beds of mud. The growing desire for education is
/// evidenced in the founding of schools and universities in Italy. Just at
/// the close of the century the since famous Palazzo Vecchio and the even
/// more famous Santa Croce were constructed. In the field of pictorial art
/// there were also evidences of the new plane of culture to which Italy had
/// attained, while scholarship found a worthy exponent in the celebrated
/// Thomas Aquinas.
///
///
/// THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY
///
/// For about a half century Italy has been free from the intrusions of the
/// emperors, but now early in the fourteenth century Henry VII crosses
/// the Alps. Unlike some of his predecessors, he meets a rather hearty
/// welcome from several of the cities and from the pope. The Florentines,
/// on the other hand, do not welcome him, and his coming leads to the usual
/// turmoils. His sudden death--perhaps from poison--dissipates all the
/// hopes based on the imperial presence. His successor, Louis of Bavaria,
/// also comes to Italy and in association with the great general Castruccio
/// makes war upon the Florentines, who have been forced much against their
/// will to put themselves under the leadership of the duke of Naples. The
/// Florentines hold their own fairly well against the outside invaders, but
/// find themselves unable to tolerate the tyranny within their walls, and
/// end by expelling the tyrant.
///
/// A striking feature of the century is the abandonment of Rome by the
/// popes, who retire to Avignon for more than seventy years, from 1305
/// to 1377, an interval famous ever since as the Babylonish captivity.
/// During the absence of the popes the Romans fared but ill. Lacking the
/// papal power which made their city a centre of world influence, they are
/// given over to minor dissensions. The famous Rienzi--"The last of the
/// tribunes"--makes an heroic effort to restore order just at the middle
/// of the century, and for a time dominates the situation; only to be
/// overthrown ingloriously after a brief period of authority.
///
/// In the north the Visconti make themselves dominant in Milan and interfere
/// perpetually in general politics, striving to subordinate all Italy to
/// their influence. Florence was brought into repeated conflicts with the
/// successive rulers of this family, and it was in these contests that the
/// great English general, Sir John Hawkwood came to the fore. Leader of a
/// band of mercenaries,--soldier of fortune in the most literal sense of
/// the word,--this famous warrior fought first against the Florentines,
/// and subsequently in their service. Despite some reverses he gained a
/// reputation which led Hallam to consider him the first great commander
/// since Roman times. This estimate perhaps does Hawkwood something more
/// than justice; it overlooks the great Castruccio, to go no further. But
/// undoubtedly Hawkwood was a redoubtable leader, and he was among the first
/// of a series of condottioria who gave distinction to Italian armies during
/// the ensuing century.
///
/// Genoa and Venice are drawn into a disastrous warfare; in fact the
/// various dominant cities of Italy are almost perpetually quarrelling.
/// Even the great plague which sweeps over Italy in 1348, despite its
/// devastations--so graphically described by Boccaccio--serves to give
/// scarcely more than a temporary lull to the dissensions. The insurrection
/// of the Ciompi, the Great Schism, and the outbreak of the war of Chioggia
/// are dissensions that mark the later decades of the century.
///
/// But all these political dissensions sink quite into insignificance in
/// comparison with the tremendous intellectual development of the time. As
/// we have seen, the western world has been preparing for centuries for the
/// development of an indigenous culture. Now the promise meets fruition. It
/// required but the waft of a breeze from the East to fan the smouldering
/// embers into flame. This vivifying influence came about partly through
/// the emigration of large numbers of scholars from Constantinople; a
/// migration incited chiefly by fear of the Turks. These scholars brought
/// with them their love of the Greek classics and stimulated the nascent
/// scholarship of Italy into a like enthusiasm. Soon there began and
/// developed a great fashion of searching for classical manuscripts, and
/// many half-forgotten authors were brought to light. It became the fashion
/// to copy these manuscripts, as every gentleman's house must now have a
/// library. The revival of interest came about in time to save more than one
/// classical author from oblivion, whose works would probably have perished
/// utterly had they been subjected to another century of neglect. Such an
/// author as Velleius Paterculus, for example, is known exclusively through
/// a single manuscript, which obviously must have escaped destruction
/// through mere chance; and everyone is aware how large a proportion of
/// classical writers were not accorded even this measure of fortune. No
/// doubt many authors were inadvertently allowed to perish even after
/// this revival of interest, but the number must have been very small in
/// proportion to those that were already lost.
///
/// But the revival of interest in the works of antiquity was by no means
/// the greatest literary feature of the time. There came with it a creative
/// impulse which gave the world the works of Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio,
/// not to mention the lesser chroniclers. Their work evidenced that
/// spontaneous outbreak of the creative impulse for which the classicism
/// of the East had been preparing. How spontaneous it was, how little
/// understood, even by its originators, is illustrated in the fact that
/// both Dante, the creator of Italian poetry, and Boccaccio, the creator
/// of Italian prose, regarded their work in the vernacular as relatively
/// unimportant; basing their hopes of immortality upon their archaic Latin
/// treatises, which the world promptly forgot. No better illustration could
/// be furnished anywhere of that spontaneity of truly creative art to which
/// we have had occasion more than once to refer.
///
/// Nor was it in literature alone that the time was creative. Pictorial art
/// had likewise its new beginning in this epoch. Cimabue, indeed, had made
/// an effort to break with the crude traditions of the eastern school of art
/// in the latter part of the thirteenth century; his greater pupil Giotto
/// developed his idea in the early decades of the fourteenth century, and
/// gathered by him, the school of painters in Florence attempted, following
/// their master, to go to nature and to reproduce what they saw. Their
/// effort was a crude and tentative one, judged according to the canons
/// of the later development; but it was the beginning of great things. In
/// architecture the effort of the time was not doomed to be content with
/// mere beginnings: "Giotto's tower," the famous Campanile, still stands
/// in evidence of the relative perfection to which this department of
/// art had attained. All in all, then, the fourteenth century was a time
/// of wonderful development in Italy; the clarion note of Dante has been
/// called the voice of ten silent centuries; it told of a new phase of the
/// Renaissance.
///
///
/// THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY
///
/// During the fifteenth century Italy enjoyed a period of relative immunity
/// from outside interference. An emperor was crowned at Rome in the early
/// days of the century, to be sure, and there were various efforts at
/// interference by other powers, including the coming of Charles VIII
/// in 1494. But, as a general thing, it was the Italians themselves who
/// competed with one another, rather than outside powers who quarrelled
/// with Italy as a whole. The great forces were, as before, the few
/// important cities. These were forever quarrelling one with another. Pisa
/// became subordinate to Florence, and the latter city waxed steadily in
/// greatness. In Milan the rule of the Visconti continued till towards the
/// middle of the century, when, on the disappearance of the last member of
/// that important family, the house of Sforza came to the fore and took to
/// itself the task of dictatorship. In Naples King Ladislaus, and later
/// Queen Joanna II, maintained regal influence and made their principality a
/// world power. Thus in the middle of the century the four great powers were
/// Naples, Milan, Venice, and Florence.
///
/// In these wars the mercenary leaders were much in evidence. These were
/// men to whom fighting was simply a business,--a means to a livelihood. No
/// question of patriotism was involved in their warfare; they gave their
/// services to the state that offered the most liberal payment in gold or
/// its equivalent. Half a dozen of these men gained particular distinction
/// in the fifteenth century. These were Braccio, Fortebraccio, Sforza
/// Attendola, and his son Francesco Sforza, Carmagnola, Niccolo Piccinino,
/// and Colleno Coleoni. These men were variously matched against one another
/// in the important wars.
///
/// Braccio and Sforza Attendola came into prominence in the papal wars,
/// having to do with the Great Schism, and beginning about the close of the
/// first decade of the fifteenth century. Braccio fought for Florence, and
/// Sforza at first for Pope John XXIII, and subsequently for King Ladislaus
/// of Naples, who at this time was the strongest ruler in Italy. This war
/// concerned most of the powers of Italy, and involved Anjou and France as
/// well. The death of Ladislaus helped to terminate the conflict, but at the
/// same time precipitated a new war, by raising the question of succession
/// to the throne of Naples.
///
/// In this war of the Neapolitan succession Fillipo Maria, duke of Milan,
/// upheld the cause of the house of Anjou, while Florence sided with
/// Alfonzo. The chief scene of the war was in the north where the forces
/// of Milan and Naples competed with those of Florence and Venice. It was
/// here that Carmagnola (born Francesco Dussone) was given the opportunity
/// to show his genius as a leader. He served first under Fillipo, but
/// subsequently entered the service of Venice and acquired new honours as
/// the opponent of his old employer. In later campaigns his chief opponent
/// was Francesco Sforza. The tragic end of Carmagnola will be recalled by
/// every reader.
///
/// After the settlement of this war of the Neapolitan succession Fillipo
/// Maria was soon embroiled again, this time with Pope Eugenius. The pope
/// took refuge in Florence and the Tuscans, again supported by Venice,
/// upheld him. Francesco Sforza now fought for the Florentines, his
/// opponent, the leader of the Visconti's army, being Niccolo Piccinino. But
/// before the war was over the Visconti had gained Sforza back again. On the
/// death of Fillipo the Milanese established a republic, avowing that they
/// would never again submit to a tyrant. But necessity soon drove them to
/// call on Francesco Sforza to aid them in a war against Venice, and their
/// successful general presently usurped power, and established a new line
/// of tyrants. In the later wars between Milan and Venice Colleno Coleoni
/// appeared, and after bartering his services first to one party and then
/// to the other, became permanently established as generalissimo of the
/// land-forces of Venice in 1454.
///
/// One of the most striking features of this warfare was that it came to
/// nothing. So many rival interests were involved, so kaleidoscopic were the
/// shiftings of the various leaders, so utterly lacking is any great central
/// cause of contention, that it is sometimes almost impossible to say where
/// one war ends and another begins. Each petty state is thinking of its own
/// interests. And the only thing approaching a general principle of action
/// is the fear on the part of each state that any other single state might
/// gain too much influence over Italy as a whole. In other words the thought
/// of maintaining a balance of power is in the mind of all such leaders as
/// have no hope of making themselves supreme. As Florence at no time has a
/// hope of becoming politically dominant, her efforts are always directed
/// towards maintaining a balance of power, and where personalities do not
/// enter into the matter, she tends in the main to champion the cause of the
/// weaker party.
///
/// But despite the interest which necessarily attaches to all these
/// political jarrings, the really world-historical importance of
/// Florentine history during this period has to do not with wars, but
/// with the marvellous internal culture development. Already in the van
/// of the Renaissance movement Florence holds her proud position securely
/// throughout the fifteenth century, and is incontestably the culture centre
/// of the world.
///
/// This was the age of the Medici. It was then that Cosmo the Great and
/// Lorenzo the Magnificent made their influence felt, and enjoyed practical
/// dictatorship, though the form of government continued a democracy. The
/// real source of Florentine influence was founded on the old familiar basis
/// of commercial prosperity. We have seen how Florence in the previous
/// century produced such men as Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio, and Giotto.
/// The intellectual supremacy thus evidenced was maintained in the ensuing
/// century, but the early part of that century has no names to show that are
/// comparable to these in artistic greatness. The stamp of the times, at
/// least of the first half of the fifteenth century, is industrial rather
/// than artistic. This is the time when the gradually increasing commercial
/// and industrial importance of Italy has culminated in unequivocal world
/// supremacy. Venice and Florence are now the commercial centres of the
/// world. In Florence various forms of craftsmanship have attained a
/// degree of importance which will make them famous for all time. The
/// guilds of woollen weavers, of cloth merchants, of silk weavers, and of
/// money-changers have become institutions of world-wide influence. The
/// money lenders of Florence are found plying their trade in every capital
/// of Europe. Despite their extortions they are regarded everywhere as
/// a necessary evil; and Florentine gold in this century exercises an
/// influence almost as wide as the quondam influence of Roman arms. The
/// Florentine money-changer holds almost unchallenged the position that
/// the Jew occupied at a later day. Oddly enough, it may be noted that the
/// Jew himself is barred from plying the trade of money lender in Florence
/// until about the end of the first third of the fifteenth century when,
/// paradoxical as it may seem, he is legally granted the privilege, to
/// protect the borrower from the extortions of the native usurers of the
/// city.
///
/// The rapid development of commerce and industry brings with it, not
/// unnaturally, a great change in the habits of the Florentine people. Early
/// in the century the houses in Florence are still simple and relatively
/// plain in their equipment. The windows are barred by shutters, glass
/// not being yet in common use; the stairways are narrow; the entrances
/// unostentatious. But before the close of the century all this is changed.
/// The power of wealth makes itself felt in the houses, equipments, and
/// costumes of the people; in their luxurious habits of living; their
/// magnificent banquets and demonstrations; and all that goes to make up a
/// life of sensuous pleasure.
///
/// Most significant of all, however, is the influence which wealth has
/// enabled one family to attain; for the power of the Medici is, in its
/// essentials, the power of gold. It is a power wielded deftly in the hands
/// of prominent representatives of the family; a power that seems to make
/// for the good of the city. Under Lorenzo the Magnificent every form of art
/// is patronised and cultivated, and Florence easily maintains its supremacy
/// as the culture centre of Italy. Such sculptors as Donatello, Berrochio,
/// and their fellows; such painters as Filippo Lippi, Botticelli, and
/// Ghirlandajo, not to mention a varied company of almost equal attainments;
/// and a company of distinguished workmen in all departments of the lesser
/// arts, lend their influence to beautify the city under the patronage of
/// Lorenzo. The school of art thus founded is to give the world such names
/// as Michelangelo and Raphael in the succeeding generations. Curiously
/// enough, by some unexplained oversight, the greatest painter of the
/// century, Leonardo da Vinci, was led to make his greatest efforts in Milan
/// and not in Florence during the life of Lorenzo, though he returned to the
/// latter city not long after the death of the great patron of art.
///
/// As a patron of literature Lorenzo was no less active. He founded and
/// developed a wonderful library in which the treasures of antiquity were
/// collected, in the original or in copies, without regard to expense, from
/// all parts of Europe. The art of book-making was carried to its highest
/// development in this period. The manuscripts of the time are marvels of
/// beauty. The ornamentation is beautiful, and the letters themselves are
/// printed with a degree of regularity closely rivalling the uniformity of
/// a printed page. And then not long after the middle of the century, just
/// when this art of the scribe was at its height, the printing-press was
/// introduced from Germany, and an easy mechanical means was at hand by
/// which the most perfect technique could be attained. True, the connoisseur
/// did not at first recognise the printed book as a possible rival of the
/// old hand-made work. For a long time the collector continued to employ
/// the hand workman, and the dilettante looked upon the printed book with
/// much the same scornful glance which the modern collector of paintings
/// bestows upon a chromo or lithograph. The first printing-press was set
/// up, according to Von Reumont, at Subiaco in a Benedictine monastery in
/// 1465. Some fifteen years later Vespasiano da Bisticci, writing about
/// the library of the duke of Urbino, could proudly state that "All the
/// volumes are of the most faultless beauty, written by hand, with elegant
/// miniatures, and all on parchment. There are no printed books among them;
/// the duke would have been ashamed to have them."[2]
///
/// Notwithstanding the scornful attitude of the connoisseur, however,
/// the art of printing books made its way rapidly. Hitherto the cost of
/// production had rendered even the most ordinary book a luxury not to
/// be possessed by any but the relatively wealthy. Naturally enough, an
/// eager band of book lovers hailed the advent of the new method, despite
/// its supposed artistic shortcomings; and before the end of the century
/// there were printing-presses in all the important centres of Italy, and
/// numberless classics, beginning with Virgil, had been given a vastly wider
/// currency than had ever previously been possible. It is needless here to
/// dwell upon the remoter influences of this rapid diffusion of classical
/// treasures; but nowhere was the influence more important than in Italy.
///
/// Summarising in a few words the influences of the fifteenth century in
/// Italy, it may be repeated that, as a whole, it is an epoch of industrial
/// and commercial progress rather than of the greatest art. The culminating
/// achievements of the century, the invention of the printing-press and the
/// discovery of America were not Italian triumphs; though as the birthplace
/// of Columbus and the home of Amerigo Vespucci, Italy cannot well be denied
/// a share in the finding of the New World. Indeed, the association of
/// Italy with this great achievement is perhaps closer than might at first
/// sight appear. For on the one hand, it is held that the geographical work
/// of Toscanelli was directly instrumental in stimulating Columbus to the
/// conception of a western passage to India; while, in another view, the
/// influence of the spirit of exploration and discovery fostered by the
/// commercial relations of Italy in making possible the feat of Columbus,
/// must have been inestimable. Be all that as it may, the discovery of the
/// New World--made in the last decade of the century, and, as it chanced in
/// the same year in which Lorenzo de' Medici died--may well be considered
/// not merely as a culminating achievement of the century, but as symbolical
/// of that commercial and industrial spirit for which the century is chiefly
/// remarkable.
///
/// We have now advanced to the date which is usually named as closing the
/// medieval epoch, but what has been said about the arbitrary character of
/// this classification should be borne in mind. The discovery of America in
/// 1492 did indeed mark the beginning of a new era in one sense, since it
/// opened up a new hemisphere to the observation and residence of civilised
/// man. That discovery, too, prepared the way for the demonstration of the
/// fact that the world is round; hence it became an important corner-stone
/// in the building of that new structure of man's conception of cosmology
/// of which the master builders were Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, and
/// Newton. But the building of this new structure,--a revolutionising of
/// man's conception of the cosmos,--did not come about in a year or a
/// century; the superstitions based on the old conception of cosmology have
/// not lost their hold on mankind even in our own day. It has even been
/// suggested that the year 1859, when the promulgation of thought occurred
/// which gave the death-blow to the old ideas of cosmogony, and which may
/// be said for the first time to have rendered the old superstitions truly
/// obsolescent,--that this year rather than the year 1492 might well be
/// named as limiting the medieval epoch. So perhaps it may be with more
/// remote generations of the future, but for the twentieth century observer
/// the older date will doubtless seem the better one. But, after all, the
/// question is one of no moment. Considering the recognised arbitrariness of
/// all such divisions it does not in the least matter as to the exact bounds
/// given to the medieval epoch.
///
///
/// THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY
///
/// The sixteenth century is a time of peculiar contrasts in Italy. The
/// invasions which began with the coming of Charles VIII in 1494 continue
/// and become more and more harassing. Italy comes to be regarded as the
/// proper prey of the French and Spanish rulers. The Italian principalities,
/// warring as ever with one another, welcome or repel the invaders in
/// accordance with their own selfish interests. All this time there has been
/// no unified government of Italy as a whole. Nominally the empire included
/// all, but this was a mere theory which, for the most part, would not bear
/// examination. Venice all along has claimed allegiance to the Eastern
/// Empire, which since the middle of the fifteenth century has ceased to
/// exist. Florence owes no allegiance to any outside power; it is strictly
/// autonomous. The democratic feeling is still strong there notwithstanding
/// the usurpations of the Medici. Venice and Florence with Siena and Lucca
/// are the only republics remaining at the beginning of the sixteenth
/// century. Of the scores of cities which formerly were republics, all the
/// rest have come under the influence of tyrants, or have been brought into
/// unwilling subordination to neighbouring cities. And now an even greater
/// humiliation is in store for many of them at the hands of the transalpine
/// conquerors.
///
/// Venice, recovering from her duel to the death with Genoa--the war of
/// Chioggia--continues to hold closely to her old traditions. Her commercial
/// prosperity continues for a time, but is gradually lessened through the
/// loss of eastern territories and through the rivalry brought about by the
/// discovery of America and of a sea route to India. Florence, having thrown
/// off in 1494 the thraldom imposed by the Medici, makes spasmodic efforts
/// to return to the old purely democratic system; but fails in the end. In
/// 1569 Cosmo de' Medici is made Grand Duke of Tuscany, a position which his
/// successors will continue to hold for seven generations (till 1737). In a
/// word the spirit of democracy is virtually dead in Italy, and as yet no
/// local tyrant arises who has the genius to unite the petty principalities
/// into a unified kingdom.
///
/// But if political Italy is chaotic and unproductive in this century the
/// case is quite different when we consider the civilisation of the time.
/// The vivifying influences of the previous century produced a development
/// particularly in the field of art, which now shows great results. The
/// early decades of the sixteenth century constitute an epoch of the
/// greatest art development in Italy. This is the age of Leonardo, of
/// Michelangelo, of Raphael, and of Titian, and of the host of disciples
/// of these masters. Under the patronage of successive popes, the master
/// painters are stimulated to their best efforts, and those wonderful
/// decorations of the Vatican are undertaken which have been the delight of
/// all later times.
///
/// The literary development, if it does not quite keep pace with the
/// pictorial, nevertheless attains heights which it has only once before
/// reached since classical times. All this culture development in a
/// time of turmoil and political disaster seems anomalous, and, as just
/// intimated, can only be explained as the fruitage of a development which
/// had its origin in an earlier epoch. The validity of this explanation
/// is illustrated in the rapid decline that takes place in Italy after
/// the middle of the sixteenth century--an intellectual decline which is
/// scarcely to be interrupted until the nineteenth century.
///
///
/// THE SEVENTEENTH AND EIGHTEENTH CENTURIES
///
/// After the wonderful development of the sixteenth century it is amazing
/// to consider this time of deterioration. The day of great men is not
/// altogether past--witness Galileo--but there are no such great poets,
/// historians, artists, as in past generations. Even the events of the
/// political world have small world-historical importance. Italy is the
/// battle-ground of nations; it is a geographical territory but it is
/// scarcely a state. It has no unity, it has no individuality; it has no
/// important autonomous states as a whole that command the attention of
/// the historian. The intellectual sceptre which Italy so long swayed has
/// been passed on to the nations of the north. The ecclesiastical spirit is
/// everywhere dominant.
///
/// The burning of Giordano Bruno in the last year of the sixteenth
/// century and the persecution of Galileo for daring to uphold the new
/// Copernican conception of cosmogony are typical features of the epoch.
/// Chronologically the medieval era is past, but the spirit of medievalism
/// still pertains in Italy; rather let us say that this unfortunate country
/// has lapsed back into an archaic cast of thought after having led the
/// world for generations.
///
/// The historian must note the play and counterplay of outside nations
/// who use the territory of Italy as their chess-board, but as regards
/// the Italian himself the world historian might virtually disregard his
/// existence during many generations. It is only towards the close of the
/// eighteenth century when Italy came under the sway of Napoleon that there
/// came about a reaction from the overbearing policy of this new tyrant;
/// then a desire for liberty began to make itself felt in Italy, and to
/// prepare the way for that struggle of a half century later which was to
/// weld the disunited subject principalities into a unified and autonomous
/// kingdom. But the intimations of this later development could hardly be
/// appreciated by the contemporary observer who saw Italy ground beneath
/// the heel of Napoleon, with no seeming chance of ever escaping from this
/// humiliating position.
///
///
/// THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
///
/// With the overthrow of Napoleon there was but slight betterment in the
/// immediate condition of Italy. An attempt was made by the powers that had
/// overthrown the French usurper to restore the Italian principalities to
/// something like their ante-revolutionary status. But, as has just been
/// noted, the spirit of liberty was taking possession of the land and its
/// long enslaved people began to dream of better things than they had known
/// for centuries. But their efforts to secure the freedom so long renounced
/// were at first only attempts; one petty rebellion after another seemed
/// to come to nothing. But, at last, under the guidance of such leaders as
/// Mazzini, Cavour, Garibaldi, and Victor Emmanuel, the seemingly impossible
/// was accomplished: outside influences were subordinated; the papal power
/// over secular affairs was restricted and at last virtually overthrown; and
/// for the first time in something like fourteen centuries the geographical
/// territory of Italy came politically under the sway of a single ruler
/// who owed no allegiance to alien lands: the dream of the visionaries was
/// accomplished: an Italian kingdom ruled by an Italian king took the place
/// of the enslaved, disunited principalities of the earlier centuries.
///
/// True, this achievement was not the culmination that some of the most
/// ardent patriots, with Mazzini at their head, had dreamed of. The aim of
/// that leader, as of many another, had been to achieve not a monarchical
/// but a republican unity. In their enthusiastic estimate the monarchical
/// form of government was obsolescent. Their enthusiasm harked back to the
/// days when Venice and Florence had carried out with so much success the
/// precepts of democracy. Their imagination was fired also by the example of
/// that newer republic of the West, whose free institutions have inspired so
/// much of emulation and so much of hatred in the minds of different classes
/// of people among the older governments of Europe. But if the dreams of
/// these enthusiasts were not to be realised, it sufficed for the more
/// conservative reformers that the constitutional monarchy, embodying many
/// of the precepts and principles of democracy, had at last brought Italy
/// under the sway of a single sceptre.

/// CHAPTER I. ITALY IN THE DARK AGE
///
///
/// [Sidenote: [476-_ca._ 1100 A.D.]]
///
/// In taking up the history of Italy we shall, for convenience, go back to
/// the year 476, when the last legitimate emperor of old Rome in the West
/// was overthrown, and briefly recapitulate the story of events during the
/// period of invasion that immediately followed. It will be recalled that
/// we have already covered the period from 476 to 1024 in much detail in
/// our study of the Western Empire, in Volume VII. It will be unnecessary,
/// therefore, to treat this epoch here in anything but the barest outline;
/// and even this will involve unavoidable repetitions. Since the later
/// emperors of the Holy Roman Empire continued for some centuries to invade
/// Italy periodically, and to claim control over its affairs, it will be
/// almost impossible to avoid repetition here also; but inasmuch as such
/// monarchs as Conrad II, Henry IV, and Frederick II are necessarily given
/// full treatment in the volumes devoted to Germany, we shall deal somewhat
/// briefly with their Italian incursions in the present connection. A
/// similar duplication of matter will necessarily be involved in dealing
/// with the medieval popes, whose history has already been chronicled in the
/// previous volume.
///
/// The story of temporal affairs in Italy lacks unity from the beginning
/// of the period under consideration till well towards the close of the
/// nineteenth century. For the most part, except during the relatively
/// brief periods when a strong emperor claimed dominion over all Italy,
/// the territory of the Italian peninsula was divided into numerous petty
/// kingdoms, no one of which attained supremacy over the others. First one
/// and then another became prominent, but often contemporaneous events
/// of local importance, having but slight world-historical importance,
/// confuse the picture, and make the presentation of the history of Italy
/// extremely difficult. We must necessarily overlook a large number of
/// such petty details, endeavouring to select such events as have real
/// importance, and to weld them into a continuous narrative. But at best
/// the story of Italian history lacks dramatic unity; the scene shifts from
/// one principality to another too frequently to make possible a really
/// harmonious presentation. We have really to do with a collection of
/// cities rather than with a nation. It is the old story of Greece over
/// again; only here there are more cities competing for supremacy, with no
/// one at any time quite so near success as Athens and Sparta respectively
/// were at successive periods. Yet Milan, Venice, and Florence at times
/// approached the goal if they did not quite attain it.[a]
///
/// Most of these cities were very old; the greater number flourished in at
/// least equal splendour in the time of the Roman Empire; some, such as
/// Milan, Verona, Bologna, Capua, were so considerable as to present an
/// image of Rome, with their circus, their amphitheatre, their tumultuous
/// and idle population, their riches and their poverty. Their administration
/// was nearly republican, most commonly composed, after the example of
/// Rome, of a curia, or municipal senate elected by the people, and of
/// duumvirs, or annual consuls. In all these towns, among the first class of
/// inhabitants were to be found the proprietors of the neighbouring land,
/// lodged in palaces with their slaves and freedmen; secondly, the artisans
/// and shopkeepers whom their necessities established around them; lastly,
/// a crowd of idle people, who had preserved just enough of land to supply,
/// with the strictest economy, the means of existence. It does not appear
/// that there was any prosperous manufactory in Italy. All manual labour,
/// as well in towns as in the country, was executed by slaves. Objects of
/// luxury, for the most part, came from Asia. War had for a long time been
/// the only occupation of the Italians; for a long period, too, the legions
/// had been levied partly among the Romans, and partly among their allies in
/// Italy: but, under the emperors, the distrust of the master seconded the
/// luxurious effeminacy of the subject, the Italians finally renounced even
/// war, and the legions were recruited only in Pannonia, Gaul, and the other
/// provinces bordering on the Rhine and the Danube.
///
/// At a later period, the barbarians who menaced Rome were seduced by
/// liberal pay to engage in its defence; and in the Roman armies the enemies
/// of Rome almost entirely replaced the Romans. The country could not, as in
/// modern states, supply the place of cities in recruiting the armies with
/// a class of men accustomed to the inclemencies of the weather and inured
/// to toil. The only labourers to be found were an oppressed foreign race,
/// who took no interest in public affairs. The Romans cultivated their land
/// either by slaves purchased from the barbarians and forced by corporal
/// punishment to labour, or by _coloni partiarii_, to whom was given a
/// small share in the harvest as wages; but, in order to oblige these last
/// to content themselves with the least possible share, they were attached
/// to the land, and nearly as much oppressed as slaves themselves. The
/// proprietors of land varied as between these two systems, according as the
/// price of slaves varied, or the _colons_ (peasants, labourers) were more
/// or less numerous; no cultivator of the land had any property in it.
///
/// The greater part was united in immense domains, sometimes embracing
/// whole provinces, the administration of which was intrusted to freedmen,
/// whose only consideration was, how to cultivate the land with the least
/// possible expense, and how to extract from their labourers the greatest
/// degree of work with the smallest quantity of food. The agriculturists, as
/// well what were called freedmen as slaves, were almost all barbarians by
/// birth, without any interest in a social order which only oppressed them,
/// without courage for its defence, and without any pecuniary resources for
/// themselves; their numbers also diminished with an alarming rapidity,
/// partly from desertion, partly from new invasions of barbarians, who
/// carried them off to sell as slaves in other Roman provinces, and finally
/// from a mortality, the necessary consequence of poverty and starvation.
///
/// Italy, nevertheless, was supposed to enjoy a constant prosperity. During
/// the entire ages of Trajan and the Antonines, a succession of virtuous and
/// philosophic emperors followed each other; the world was in peace; the
/// laws were wise and well administered; riches seemed to increase; each
/// succeeding generation raised palaces more splendid, monuments and public
/// edifices more sumptuous, than the preceding; the senatorial families
/// found their revenues increase; the treasury levied greater imposts. But
/// it is not on the mass of wealth, it is on its distribution, that the
/// prosperity of states depends; increasing opulence continued to meet
/// the eye, but men became more miserable; the rural population, formerly
/// active, robust, and energetic, were succeeded by a foreign race, while
/// the inhabitants of towns sank in vice and idleness, or perished in want,
/// amidst the riches they had themselves created.
///
///
/// THE BARBARIAN INVADERS
///
/// [Sidenote: [476-814 A.D.]]
///
/// It was into this Italy, such as despotism had made it, that the
/// barbarians penetrated. Eager for the booty which it contained and could
/// not defend, they repeatedly ravaged it during the last two centuries of
/// the Western Empire. The mercenary troops that Rome had levied amongst
/// them for its defence, preferring pillage to pay, frequently turned their
/// arms against those they were engaged to defend. They vied with the Romans
/// in making and unmaking emperors; and generally chose them from their own
/// ranks, in order to secure to the soldier a greater share of the property
/// of the citizen. The booty diminished as the avidity of these foreigners
/// increased. The pomp of the Western Empire soon appeared, to an army thus
/// formed, a useless expense. Odoacer, of the nation of the Heruli, chief
/// of the mercenaries who then served in Italy, suppressed it by deposing,
/// in 476, the last emperor. He took upon himself the title of king, and
/// distributed among his soldiers one-third of the land in the most fertile
/// provinces; he governed during seventeen years this still glorious
/// country, as a rich farm which the barbarians had a right to cultivate for
/// their sole use.
///
/// The mercenaries united under the sceptre of Odoacer were not sufficiently
/// strong to defend Italy against a new invasion of barbarians. The
/// Ostrogoths, encouraged by the Grecian sovereign of new Rome, the emperor
/// of the East, arrived in 489, under the command of Theodoric, from the
/// countries north of the Euxine to the borders of Italy; they completed
/// the conquest of it in four, and retained possession of the peninsula
/// sixty-four years, under eight successive kings. These new barbarians,
/// in their turn, demanded and obtained a portion of land and slaves; they
/// multiplied, it is true, but became rapidly enervated in a delicious
/// climate where they had suddenly passed from the severest privations to
/// the enjoyment of every luxury. They were at last conquered and subdued
/// in the year 553 by the Romans of Constantinople, whom they despised as
/// the degenerate successors of the same nation which their ancestors had
/// vanquished.
///
/// The invasion of the Lombards in 568 soon followed the destruction of
/// the monarchy of the Ostrogoths. Amongst the various hordes which issued
/// from the north of Germany upon the southern regions, the Lombards were
/// reputed the most courageous, the most cruel, and the proudest of their
/// independence; but their number was inconsiderable, and they scarcely
/// acknowledged any social tie sufficient to keep them united: accordingly,
/// they never completed the conquest of Italy. From 568 to 774, twenty-one
/// Lombard kings during 206 years succeeded each other without establishing
/// their dominion either on the lagunes, at the extremity of the Adriatic
/// Gulf, where such of the inhabitants of upper Italy as were personally the
/// most exposed had taken refuge and founded the Venetian Republic; or on
/// the shores of the Adriatic, now called Romagna, governed by a lieutenant
/// of the emperor of Constantinople, under the title of exarch of the
/// five cities of Pentapolis; or on Rome, defended only by the spiritual
/// arms of the patriarch of the Western church; or on the southern coast,
/// where the Greek municipalities of Naples, Gaeta, and Amalfi governed
/// themselves almost as independent republics. The Lombards, nevertheless,
/// founded a kingdom in northern Italy, of which Pavia was the capital; and
/// in southern Italy the duchy of Benevento, which still maintained its
/// independence two centuries after the kingdom was subjugated.
///
/// From the middle of the eighth century the Lombards, masters of a country
/// where the great towns still contained much wealth, where the land had
/// lost nothing of its fertility, where the example of the vanquished had
/// taught the vanquishers the advantage of reviving some agricultural
/// industry, excited the envy of their neighbours the Franks, who had
/// conquered and oppressed the Gauls, who despised all occupation but war,
/// and desired no wealth but what the sword could give. They by repeated
/// invasions devastated Italy; and at length, in 774, completed the
/// destruction of the Lombard monarchy.
///
/// For more than twenty years the popes or bishops of Rome had been in the
/// habit of opposing the kings of France to the monarchs of Lombardy, who
/// were odious to them, at first as pagans, and afterwards as heretics.
/// Chief of the clergy of the ancient capital, where the power of the
/// emperors of Constantinople had been nominally established but never
/// felt, they confounded their pretensions with those of the empire; and
/// the Lombards having recently conquered the exarchate of Ravenna, and the
/// Pentapolis, they demanded that these provinces should be restored to
/// Rome. The Frankish kings made themselves the champions of this quarrel,
/// which gave them an opportunity of conquering the Lombard monarchy;
/// but Charles, the king who accomplished this conquest, and who was the
/// greatest man that barbarism ever produced, in treating with Rome, in
/// subjugating Italy, comprehended all the beauty of a civilisation which
/// his predecessors had seen only to destroy; he conceived the lofty idea
/// of profiting by the barbarian force at his disposal to put himself at
/// the head of the civilisation which he laboured to restore. Instead of
/// considering himself as the king of the conquerors, occupied only in
/// enriching a barbarous army with the spoils of the vanquished, he made
/// it his duty and his glory to govern the country for its best interests,
/// and for the common good. He did more: in concert with Pope Leo III,
/// he re-established the monarchy of the conquered as a western Roman
/// empire, which he considered the representative of right, in opposition
/// to barbaric force; he received from the same pope, and from the Roman
/// people, on Christmas Day in the year 800, the title of Roman emperor, and
/// the name of Charlemagne, or Charles the Great, which no one before had
/// ever so well deserved.
///
///
/// CHARLEMAGNE AND HIS SUCCESSORS
///
/// [Sidenote: [814-1039 A.D.]]
///
/// As king, and afterwards as emperor, he governed Italy, together with
/// his other vast states, forty years; he pursued with constancy, and with
/// increasing ability, the end he proposed to himself, _viz._, establishing
/// the reign of the laws, and a flourishing civilisation: but barbarism
/// was too strong for him; and when he died in 814 it was re-established
/// throughout the empire.
///
/// Italy had eight kings of the family of Charlemagne, reckoning his son
/// and grandson, who reigned under him, and were, properly speaking, his
/// lieutenants. Charles the Fat, great-grandson of Charlemagne, was deposed
/// in 888; after which ten sovereigns, either Italian or Burgundian, but
/// allied to the race of the Franks, disputed for seventy years more the
/// crown of Italy and the empire. In 951 Otto I of Saxony, king of Germany,
/// forced Berenger II, who then reigned, to acknowledge himself his vassal;
/// in 961 Otto entered Italy a second time with his Germans, was crowned at
/// Rome with the title of emperor, and sent Berenger II to end his days in a
/// fortress in Germany.
///
/// Nearly five centuries elapsed from the fall of the ancient Roman Empire
/// to the passing over of the renewed empire to the Germans. For a long
/// space of time Italy had been pillaged and oppressed in turn by barbarians
/// of every denomination, who wantonly overran the country only to plunder,
/// and believed themselves valiant because, though in small numbers, they
/// spread terror over a vast extent, and imagined by bloodshed to give a
/// dignity to their depredations. The country, thus exposed to so many
/// outrages, did not remain such as the Romans had left it. The Goth,
/// Lombard, Frank, and German warriors, who had successively invaded Italy,
/// introduced several of the opinions and sentiments of the barbarian race,
/// particularly the habit of independence and resistance to authority. They
/// divided with their kings the country conquered by their valour. They
/// caused to be ceded to them vast districts, the inhabitants of which they
/// considered their property equally with the land. The Lombard monarchy
/// comprehended thirty dukedoms, or marquisates; their number diminished
/// under Charlemagne and his successors; but at the same time there rose
/// under them a numerous class of counts and _vavaseurs_, amongst whom every
/// duke divided the province that had been ceded to him, under condition
/// that they should swear fealty and homage, and follow him to the wars.
/// The counts, in their turn, divided among the warriors attached to their
/// colours the land apportioned to them. Thus was the feudal system,
/// which made the possession of land the warrior's pay, and constituted
/// an hereditary subordination founded on interest and confirmed by oath
/// from the king down to the lowest soldier, established at the same time
/// throughout Europe. The Lombards had carried into Italy the first germs
/// of this system which had been developed by the Franks and invigorated by
/// the civil wars of Charlemagne and his successors; these wars rendered it
/// necessary that every feudatory should fortify his dwelling to preserve
/// his allegiance to his lord; and the country, which till then had been
/// open and without defence, became covered with castles, in which these
/// feudal lords established their residence.
///
/// About the same time--that is to say, in the ninth century--cities
/// began to rebuild their ancient walls; for the barbarian kings who had
/// everywhere levelled these walls to the ground no longer opposed their
/// reconstruction, and the danger of being invaded by the rival princes
/// who disputed the throne made them necessary; besides, at this epoch new
/// swarms of barbarians from all parts infested Europe; the inhabitants of
/// Scandinavia, under the name of Danes and Normans, ravaged England and
/// France; the Hungarians devasted Germany and upper Italy; the Saracens,
/// masters of Africa, infested the southern coasts of Italy and the isles:
/// conquest was not the purpose of any of these invaders; plunder and
/// massacre were their only objects. Permission to guard themselves against
/// continual outrages could not be withheld from the inhabitants of towns.
/// Several thousand citizens had often been obliged to pay ransom to little
/// more than a hundred robbers; but, from the time they were permitted by
/// their emperors to rebuild their walls, to purchase or manufacture arms,
/// they felt themselves in a state to make themselves respected. Their
/// long suffering had hardened them, had accustomed them to privations and
/// danger, and had taught them it was better to defend their lives than
/// yield them up to every contemptible aggressor; at the same time, the
/// population of cities, no longer living in idleness at the expense of
/// the provinces of the empire, addicted themselves to industry for their
/// own profit: they had, accordingly, some wealth to defend. The ancient
/// curie and municipalities had been retained in all the towns of Italy
/// by their barbarian masters, in order to distribute more equally the
/// burdens imposed by the conquerors, and reach individuals more surely. The
/// magistrates were the chiefs of a people who demanded only bread, arms,
/// and walls.
///
/// In the meantime the dukes, marquises, counts, and prelates, who looked on
/// these cities as their property, on the inhabitants as men who belonged
/// to them, and laboured only for their use, soon perceived that these
/// citizens were ill disposed to obey, and would not suffer themselves to
/// be despoiled, since they had arms, and could defend themselves under the
/// protection of their walls: residence in towns thus became disagreeable to
/// the nobles, and they left them to establish themselves in their castles.
/// They became sensible that to defend these castles they had need of men
/// devoted to them; that, notwithstanding the advantage which their heavy
/// armour gave them when fighting on horseback, they were the minority; and
/// they hastened to enfranchise the rural population, to encourage their
/// growth, to give them arms, and to endeavour to gain their affections.
/// The effect of this change of rule was rapid: the rural population in the
/// tenth and eleventh centuries increased, doubled, quadrupled in exact
/// proportion to the land which they had to cultivate.
///
/// Otto I, his son Otto II, and his grandson Otto III were successively
/// acknowledged emperors and kings of Italy, from 961 to 1002. When this
/// branch of the house of Saxony became extinct, Henry II of Bavaria and
/// Conrad the Salian of Franconia filled the throne from 1004 to 1039.
/// During this period of nearly eighty years, the German emperors twelve
/// times entered Italy at the head of their armies, which they always drew
/// up in the plains of Roncaglia near Piacenza: there they held the states
/// of Lombardy, received homage from their Italian feudatories, caused the
/// rents due to be paid, and promulgated laws for the government of Italy.
/// A foreign sovereign, however, almost always absent, known only by his
/// incursions at the head of a barbarous army, could not efficaciously
/// govern a country which he hardly knew, and where his yoke was detested.
/// During these five reigns, the social power became more and more weak in
/// Italy. The emperors were too happy to acknowledge the local authorities,
/// whatever they were, whenever they could obtain from them their pecuniary
/// dues: sometimes they were dukes or marquises, whose dignities had
/// survived the disasters of various invasions and of civil wars; sometimes
/// the archbishops and bishops of great cities, whom Charlemagne and his
/// successors had frequently invested with duchies and counties escheated
/// to the crown, reckoning that lords elected for life would remain more
/// dependent than hereditary lords; sometimes, finally, they were the
/// magistrates themselves, who, although elected by the people, received
/// from the monarch the title of imperial vicars, and took part with the
/// nobles and prelates in the _plaids_ (_placita_), or diets of Roncaglia.
///
/// In the time of Conrad the Salian, the prelates almost throughout Lombardy
/// joined the cities against the nobles; and from 1035 to 1039 there was
/// a general war between these two orders of society. Conrad put an end
/// to it, by a constitution which is considered to be the basis of feudal
/// law. By this the inheritance of fiefs was protected from the caprices of
/// the lords and of the crown,--the most oppressive conditions of feudal
/// dependence were suppressed or softened,--and the few remaining slaves of
/// the land were set free.
///
///
/// THE EMPIRE AND THE PAPACY
///
/// The crown of Conrad the Salian passed in a direct line to his son,
/// grandson, and great-grandson. The first, Henry III, reigned from 1039 to
/// 1056; the second, Henry IV, from 1056 to 1106; the third, Henry V, from
/// 1106 to 1125. The last two reigns were troubled by the bloody quarrel
/// between the empire and the court of Rome, called the war of investitures.
/// Rome had never made part of the monarchy of the Lombards. This ancient
/// capital of the world, with the territory appertaining to it, had, since
/// the conquest of Alboin, formed a dukedom, governed by a patrician or
/// Greek duke, sent from Constantinople. The bishop of Rome, however, who,
/// according to the ancient canonical forms, was elected by the clergy, the
/// senate, and the people of his diocese, had much more authority over his
/// flock than this foreign magistrate.
///
/// [Sidenote: [717-1125 A.D.]]
///
/// The pontiff, however, who now began to take exclusively the name of pope,
/// had more than once successfully defended Rome with his spiritual arms
/// when temporal ones had failed. When, in the year 717, an iconoclast, or
/// enemy of images, filled the throne of Constantinople, the popes under the
/// pretence of heresy rejected his authority altogether; a municipality, at
/// the head of which were a senate and consuls, then governed Rome nearly as
/// an independent state; the Greeks, occupied with their own dissensions,
/// seemed to forget it; and Rome owed to this forgetfulness fifty years of
/// a sort of liberty. The Romans found once more a faint image of their
/// past glory; sometimes even the title of Roman Republic was revived. They
/// approved, notwithstanding, of Pope Stephen II conferring on the princes
/// of the Franks the dignity of patricians, in order to transfer to them the
/// authority which the Greek magistrate exercised in their city in the name
/// of the emperor of Constantinople; and the people gladly acquiesced when,
/// in the year 800, Leo III crowned Charlemagne as augustus, and restorer of
/// the Western Empire. From that period Rome became once more the capital of
/// the empire. At Rome the chiefs of the empire were henceforth to receive
/// the golden crown from the hands of the pope, after having received the
/// silver one of the kingdom of Germany at Aachen, and the iron crown of
/// Lombardy at Milan.
///
/// Great wealth and much feudal power were, by the gratitude of the
/// emperors, attached to the see of Rome. The papacy became the highest
/// object of ambition to the whole sacerdotal order; and, in an age of
/// violence and anarchy, barons notorious for their robberies, and young
/// libertines recommended only by the favour of some Roman ladies, not
/// unfrequently filled the pontifical chair. The other bishops selected
/// were often no better. The German emperors, on arriving at Rome, were
/// sometimes obliged to put an end to such a scandal, and choose among the
/// competitors, or depose a pope who put all Christendom to the blush. Henry
/// III obliged the people to renounce the right which they had hitherto
/// exercised, and so greatly abused, to take part in the election of popes.
/// He, himself, named four successively, whom he chose from among the most
/// learned and the most pious of the clergy of Italy and Germany; and thus
/// powerfully seconded the spirit of reform which began to animate the
/// church from the eleventh century.
///
///
/// THE DISUNITED MUNICIPALITIES
///
/// [Sidenote: [1046-1122 A.D.]]
///
/// The war of investitures, which lasted more than sixty years, accomplished
/// the dissolution of every tie between the different members of the
/// kingdom of Italy. Civil wars have at least this advantage--that they
/// force the rulers of the people to consult the wishes of their subjects,
/// oblige them to gain affections which constitute their strength, and to
/// compensate, by the granting of new privileges, the services which they
/// require. The prelates, nobles, and cities of Italy obeyed, some the
/// emperor, others the pope; not from a blind fear, but from choice, from
/// affection, from conscience, according as the political or religious
/// sentiment was predominant in each. The war was general, but everywhere
/// waged with the national forces. Every city armed its militia, which,
/// headed by the magistrates, attacked the neighbouring nobles or towns of a
/// contrary party. While each city imagined it was fighting either for the
/// pope or the emperor, it was habitually impelled exclusively by its own
/// sentiments: every town considered itself as a whole, as an independent
/// state, which had its own allies and enemies; each citizen felt an ardent
/// patriotism, not for the kingdom of Italy, or for the empire, but for his
/// own city.
///
/// At the period when either kings or emperors had granted to towns the
/// right of raising fortifications, that of assembling the citizens at the
/// sound of a great bell, to concert together the means of their common
/// defence, had been also conceded. This meeting of all the men of the
/// state capable of bearing arms was called a parliament. It assembled in
/// the great square, and elected annually two consuls, charged with the
/// administration of justice at home, and the command of the army abroad.
/// The militia of every city was divided into separate bodies, according
/// to local partitions, each led by a _gonfaloniere_, or standard-bearer.
/// They fought on foot, and assembled round the _carroccio_, a heavy car
/// drawn by oxen, and covered with the flags and armorial bearings of the
/// city. A high pole rose in the middle of this car, bearing the colours
/// and a Christ, which seemed to bless the army, with both arms extended.
/// A priest said daily mass at an altar placed in the front of the car.
/// The trumpeters of the community, seated on the back part, sounded
/// the charge and the retreat. It was Heribert, archbishop of Milan,[3]
/// contemporary of Conrad the Salian, who invented this car in imitation of
/// the ark of alliance, and caused it to be adopted at Milan. All the free
/// cities of Italy followed the example: this sacred car, entrusted to the
/// guardianship of the militia, gave them weight and confidence. The nobles
/// who committed themselves in the civil wars, and were obliged to have
/// recourse to the protection of towns, where they had been admitted into
/// the first order of citizens, formed the only cavalry.
///
/// The parliament, which named the consuls, appointed also a secret council,
/// called a _consilio di credenza_, to assist the government, composed of
/// a few members taken from each division; besides a grand council of the
/// people, who prepared the decisions to be submitted to the parliament.
/// The _consilio di credenza_ was, at the same time, charged with the
/// administration of the finances, consisting chiefly of entrance duties
/// collected at the gates of the city, and voluntary contributions asked of
/// the citizens in moments of danger. As industry had rapidly increased,
/// and had preceded luxury, as domestic life was sober, and the produce
/// of labour considerable, wealth had greatly augmented. The citizens
/// allowed themselves no other use of their riches than that of defending
/// or embellishing their country. It was from the year 900 to the year 1200
/// that the most prodigious works were undertaken and accomplished by the
/// towns of Italy. They began by surrounding themselves with thick walls,
/// ditches, towers, and counter guards at the gates; immense works, which a
/// patriotism ready for every sacrifice could alone accomplish. The maritime
/// towns at the same time constructed their ports, quays, canals, and
/// custom-houses, which served also as vast magazines for commerce. Every
/// city built public palaces for the _signoria_, or municipal magistrates,
/// and prisons; and constructed also temples, which to this day fill us with
/// admiration by their grandeur and magnificence. These three regenerating
/// centuries gave an impulse to architecture, which soon awakened the other
/// fine arts.
///
/// [Sidenote: [568-1200 A.D.]]
///
/// The republican spirit which now fermented in every city, and gave to
/// each of them constitutions so wise, magistrates so zealous, and citizens
/// so patriotic and so capable of great achievements, had found in Italy
/// itself the models which had contributed to its formation. The war of
/// investitures gave wing to this universal spirit of liberty and patriotism
/// in all the municipalities of Lombardy, in Piedmont, Venetia, Romagna, and
/// Tuscany. But there existed already in Italy other free cities, of which
/// the experience had been sufficiently long to prove that a petty people
/// finds, in its complete union and devotion to the common cause, a strength
/// often wanting in great states. The free cities which flourished in the
/// eleventh century rose from the ruins of the Western Empire; as those in
/// Italy which preceded them in the career of liberty rose from the ruins of
/// the empire of the East.
///
/// When the Greeks resigned to the Lombards Italy, which a few years before
/// they had conquered from the Ostrogoths, they still preserved several
/// isolated ports and fortified places along the coast. Venice, at the
/// extremity of the Adriatic; Ravenna, at the south of the mouth of the Po;
/// Genoa, at the foot of the Ligurian Mountains; Pisa, towards the mouths of
/// the Arno; Rome, Gaeta, Naples, Amalfi, Bari, were either never conquered
/// by the Lombards, or were in subjection too short a time to have lost
/// their ancient walls and the habit of guarding them. These cities served
/// as the refuge of Roman civilisation. All those who had preserved any
/// fortune, independence of mind, or hatred of oppression, assembled in
/// them to concert the means of resisting the insolence of their barbarian
/// masters. The Grecian Empire maintained itself at Constantinople in all
/// its ancient pride; but, with oriental apathy, it regarded these remains
/// as still representing its province of Italy, while it did nothing for
/// their defence. From time to time, a duke, an exarch, a patrician, a
/// catapan, or other magistrate, was sent, with a title announcing the
/// highest pretensions, but unaccompanied by any real force. The citizens
/// of these towns demanded money and soldiers to repair and defend their
/// fortifications; whilst the emperors, on the contrary, demanded that the
/// money and soldiers of Italy should be sent to Constantinople. After some
/// disputes, the Greek government found it prudent to abandon the question,
/// and shut its eyes to the establishment of a liberty it despised,
/// but which perhaps might be useful in the defence of these distant
/// possessions; finally, the magistrates, whom these towns themselves
/// nominated, became the acknowledged depositories of the imperial
/// authority. The disposal of their own money and soldiers was allowed them,
/// on condition that nothing should be demanded of the emperors, who were
/// satisfied to see their names at the head of every act, and their image on
/// the coin, without exacting other acts of submission. This policy was not,
/// however, exactly followed with respect to Ravenna, or afterwards to Bari.
/// In these cities the representative of the emperor had fixed his residence
/// with a Greek garrison. Ravenna, as well as the cities appertaining to
/// it, denominated the Pentapolis, was conquered by the Lombards between
/// 720 and 730. Bari became then the capital of the _thema_ of Lombardy,
/// which extended over a great part of Apulia. We have already shown how
/// Rome passed from the Greek to the Western Empire: we suspect, rather than
/// know, that Genoa and Pisa, after having been occupied by the Lombards,
/// preserved their relations with Constantinople. The _pallium_, or silk
/// flag, presented for some time to the emperors, was considered by them
/// as a sort of tribute; but Venice on the upper sea, Gaeta, Naples, and
/// Amalfi, on the lower, advanced more openly to independence.
