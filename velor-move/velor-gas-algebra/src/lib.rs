//! This crate extends Move's gas algebra by introducing Velor-specific counting units.
//!
//! It provides an abstract algebra that goes beyond concrete quantities and allows
//! the representation of gas expressions.
//!
//! These expressions can be evaluated or interpreted symbolically, opening up possibilities
//! for building advanced analysis tools.
