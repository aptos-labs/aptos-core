/// This module provides an interface for aggregators. Aggregators are similar to
/// unsigned integers and support addition and subtraction (aborting on underflow
/// or on overflowing a custom upper limit). The difference from integers is that
/// aggregators allow to perform both additions and subtractions in parallel across
/// multiple transactions, enabling parallel execution. For example, if the first
/// transaction is doing `add(X, 1)` for aggregator resource `X`, and the second
/// is doing `sub(X,3)`, they can be executed in parallel avoiding a read-modify-write
/// dependency.
/// However, reading the aggregator value (i.e. calling `read(X)`) is an expensive
/// operation and should be avoided as much as possible because it reduces the
/// parallelism. Moreover, **aggregators can only be created by Velor Framework (0x1)
/// at the moment.**
