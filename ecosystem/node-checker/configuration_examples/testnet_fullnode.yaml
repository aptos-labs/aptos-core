# Here we only use metrics checks that rely on the API port being open, since the
# metrics port is closed and there are no meaningful noise based checks for fullnodes
# at the moment. There are still metrics checks, but only those that rely on the
# metrics port of the target node being open. Since this config is for the operator's
# benefit, we don't mark any check as required, meaning if they only provide the
# metrics port for example, we'll only run metrics checks.
