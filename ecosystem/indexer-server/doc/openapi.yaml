      title: Event Key
      type: string

        Event key is a global index for an event stream.

        It is hex-encoded BCS bytes of `EventHandle` `guid` field value, which is
        a combination of a `uint64` creation number and account address
        (without trimming leading zeros).

        For example, event key `0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000a550c18`
        is combined by the following 2 parts:
          1. `0000000000000000`: `uint64` representation of `0`.
          2. `0000000000000000000000000a550c18`: 16 bytes of account address.
      example: "0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000a550c18"

        Note:

      description: |
        String representation of an on-chain Move type identifier defined by the Move language.

        Values:
          - bool

          - u64
          - u128
          - address

          - reference: immutable `&` and mutable `&mut` references.
          - generic_type_parameter: it is always start with `T` and following an index number,
            which is the position of the generic type parameter in the `struct` or
            `function` generic type parameters definition.

        Vector type value examples:
          * `vector<u8>`
          * `vector<vector<u64>>`
          * `vector<0x1::AptosAccount::Balance<0x1::XDX::XDX>>`

        Struct type value examples:

          * `0x1::Abc::Abc<vector<u8>, vector<u64>>`

        Reference type value examples:
          * `&signer`
          * `&mut address`
          * `&mut vector<u8>`

        Generic type parameter value example, the following is `0x1::TransactionFee::TransactionFee` JSON representation:

            {
                "name": "TransactionFee",
                "is_native": false,
                "abilities": ["key"],

                    {"constraints": [], "is_phantom": true}
                ],
                "fields": [
                    { "name": "balance", "type": "0x1::Aptos::Aptos<T0>" },
                    { "name": "preburn", "type": "0x1::Aptos::Preburn<T0>" }
                ]
            }

        It's Move source code:

            module AptosFramework::TransactionFee {
                struct TransactionFee<phantom CoinType> has key {
                    balance: Aptos<CoinType>,
                    preburn: Preburn<CoinType>,
                }
            }

        The `T0` in the above JSON representation is the generic type place holder for
        the `CoinType` in the Move source code.

        Note:
          1. Empty chars should be ignored when comparing 2 struct tag ids.
          2. When used in an URL path, should be encoded by url-encoding (AKA percent-encoding).

    MoveValue:
      title: Move Value
      description: |
        Move `bool` type value is serialized into `boolean`.

        Move `u8` type value is serialized into `integer`.

        Move `u64` and `u128` type value is serialized into `string`.

        Move `address` type value(16 bytes Aptos account address) is serialized into
        hex-encoded string, which is prefixed with `0x` and leading zeros are trimmed.

        For example:
          * `0x1`
          * `0x1668f6be25668c1a17cd8caf6b8d2f25`

        Move `vector` type value is serialized into `array`, except `vector<u8>` which is
        serialized into hex-encoded string with `0x` prefix.

        For example:
          * `vector<u64>{255, 255}` => `["255", "255"]`
          * `vector<u8>{255, 255}` => `0xffff`

        Move `struct` type value is serialized into `object` that looks like this (except some Move stdlib types, see the following section):

          ```json
          {
            field1_name: field1_value,
            field2_name: field2_value,
            ......
          }
          ```

        For example:
          `{ "created": "0xa550c18", "role_id": "0" }`

        **Special serialization for Move stdlib types:**

        * [0x1::ASCII::String](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/language/move-stdlib/docs/ASCII.md) is serialized into `string`. For example, struct value `0x1::ASCII::String{bytes: b"hello world"}` is serialized as `"hello world"` in JSON.
