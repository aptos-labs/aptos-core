## IMPORTANT NOTE TO EDITORS OF THIS FILE ##

## Note that when you create a PR the jobs in this file are triggered off the
## `pull_request_target` event instead of `pull_request` event. This is because
## the `pull_request` event makes secrets only available to PRs from branches,
## not from forks, and some of these jobs require secrets. So with `pull_request_target`
## we're making secrets available to fork-based PRs too. Using `pull_request_target"
## has a side effect, which is that the workflow execution will be driven by the
## state of the <workflow>.yaml on the `main` (=target) branch, even if you edited
## the <workflow>.yaml in your PR. So when you for example add a new job here, you
## won't see that job appear in the PR itself. It will only become effective once
## you merge the PR to main. Therefore, if you want to add a new job here and want
## to test it's functionality prior to a merge to main, you have to to _temporarily_
## change the trigger event from `pull_request_target` to `pull_request`.

## Additionally, because `pull_request_target` gets secrets injected for forked PRs
## we use `https://github.com/sushichop/action-repository-permission` to ensure these
## jobs are only executed when a repo member with "write" permission has triggered
## the workflow (directly through a push or indirectly by applying a label or enabling
## auto_merge).
