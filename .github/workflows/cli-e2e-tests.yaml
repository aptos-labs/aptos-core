  # This is called from within the docker-build-test.yaml workflow since we depend
  # on the build of the image of the CLI we're testing having been built before this
  # workflow runs. You can see in the invocation of the test suite that we pass in
  # the image repo we just built and pushed the tools image to and the git SHA1 of
  # the commit / PR that triggered this workflow.

# TODO: should we migrate this to a composite action, so that we can skip it
# at the call site, and don't need to wrap each step in an if statement?
jobs:
  # Run the Aptos CLI examples. We run the CLI on this commit / PR against a
  # local testnet using the devnet, testnet, and mainnet branches. This way
  # we ensure that the Aptos CLI works with all 3 prod networks, at least
  # based on the tests in the test suite.
