# These tests ensure that changes to the faucet itself or its code dependencies don't
# cause the faucet to stop working with the production (devnet and testnet) networks.
#
# For tests that prevent the node from breaking compatibility with the faucet, see
# faucet-tests-main.
#
# These tests use node images built from devnet / testnet so we don't need to use
# workflow_call to wait for the image build to finish.
