# This set of CI steps checks that the docs site examples work against devnet.
# These steps don't guarantee that the examples will never break, since the
# devnet release, SDK release, and examples release are all indepdent events.
# So this check should never be marked land blocking, since there is an
# unavoidable period of time where they will be incompatible with each devnet
# release. Instead, this should serve as a notification that the examples are
# broken, so we notice that they're broken before the community does.

# Explaining another way, there are two types of compatability we check:
#   - Compatibility between SDK and node on a particular commit
#   - Compatibility between SDK on package manager and node on devnet
#
# This CI checks the second type of compatability, the sdk-release.yaml CI
# steps check the first type.

# NOTE: This is all subject to change soon, see this PR:
# https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/pull/3485
