# Each of these jobs runs the TS SDK E2E tests from this commit against a local testnet
# built from one of the production release branches. In other words, we run the TS SDK
# tests against a local devnet, testnet, and mainnet. We also run the TS SDK tests for
# the indexer, though those run against the production indexer for now.

  # Run the TS SDK indexer tests. Note: Unlike the above tests where everything is self
  # contained because we run a local testnet, these tests operate against the
  # production indexer service. This service can be flaky so we don't want those tests
  # to be land blocking for any PR on the aptos repo. This is why we run those tests
  # separate from test-sdk-confirm-client-generated-publish.
