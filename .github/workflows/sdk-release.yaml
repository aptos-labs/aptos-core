## IMPORTANT NOTE TO EDITORS OF THIS FILE ##

## If you are trying to change how this CI works, you MUST go read the important
## note at the top of docker-build-test.yaml. In short, to test this, you must temporarily
## change docker-build-test to use the pull_request trigger instead of pull_request_target.

## Make sure to add the CICD:CICD:build-images and CICD:run-e2e-tests labels to test
## this within an in-review PR.

## If the above approach is too slow (since you have to wait for the rust images
## to build), you can cut the iteration time dramatically by adding a push trigger
## and replacing inputs.GITHUB_SHA with a specific commit from the main branch for
## which you know the rust images step has completed. So to be clear:
##   - Replace ${{ inputs.GIT_SHA }} for the checkout step with ${{ github.sha }}
##   - Replace all other instances of ${{ inputs.GIT_SHA }} with the said specific commit.
