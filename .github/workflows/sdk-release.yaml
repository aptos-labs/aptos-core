# Note: To test changes to this workflow, it is not sufficient to just make a
# PR and see how it works there. If you do that, the PR will not use the
# changes you made to this workflow, it'll use the workflow from the commit
# that the PR is based on. This is because the parent workflow, build-images,
# uses github.event.pull_request.head.sha as the value for GIT_SHA, not github.sha.
# With that in mind, the best way to test changes to this workflow is instead to
# temporarily add something like this to the workflow, under `on`:
#
#   push:
#     branches:
#       - banool/improve-sdk-release
#
# Where you provide the name of the branch on which you're making the changes.
# This is an example: https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/commit/d4a03de85af388611c2e69fc8e14bd63ddaf4a04
