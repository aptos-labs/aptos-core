## IMPORTANT NOTE TO EDITORS OF THIS FILE ##

## If you are trying to change how this CI works, you MUST go read the important
## note at the top of docker-build-test.yaml. In short, to test this, you must temporarily
## change docker-build-test to use the pull_request trigger instead of pull_request_target.

## Make sure to add the CICD:CICD:build-images and CICD:run-e2e-tests labels to test
## this within an in-review PR.

## If the above approach is too slow (since you have to wait for the rust images
## to build), you can cut the iteration time dramatically by changing the envs
##   - Replace env.IMAGE_TAG for a known image tag
##   - env.GIT_SHA will resolve to that of your PR branch

# These tests ensure that the Node API, the OpenAPI spec that is generated from it,
# and the TS SDK inner client that is generated from that, all match up.
