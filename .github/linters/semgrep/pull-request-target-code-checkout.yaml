    message: This GitHub Actions workflow file uses `pull_request_target` and checks
      out code from the incoming pull request. When using `pull_request_target`,
      the Action runs in the context of the target repository, which includes
      access to all repository secrets. Please ensure you have `permission-check`
      enabled for the jobs that check out code. Please see
      https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/
      for additional mitigations.
