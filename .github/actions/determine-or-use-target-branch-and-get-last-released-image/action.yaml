name: "Determine or Use Target Branch and Get Latest Docker Image"
description: |
  Determine the branch to fetch the latest docker image tag from, or use a target branch directly.
  - If base-branch is set, determine the target branch to fetch the latest docker image tag from
    - Determine the IMAGE_TAG based on the latest release R and check for images built on branch R - 1:
      - For commits on the aptos-release-v1.19 branch, the IMAGE_TAG should be the latest commit built on aptos-release-v1.18
      - For commits on the main branch, the IMAGE_TAG should be the latest commit on the max release aptos-release-v<X.X> branch
      - For commits on other branches, the IMAGE_TAG should be the latest commit on the branch's last release aptos-release-v<X.X> branch
  - If branch is set, use it directly
