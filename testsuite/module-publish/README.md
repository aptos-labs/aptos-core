## Deprecation notice

This flow to add benchmarks is deprecated and no longer used.
The code is kept for some time until the testnet release binary contains the new way of reading precompiled Move modules.
Use scripts from `benchmark-workloads` instead:

```bash
cd testsuite/benchmark-workloads
./generate.py
```
