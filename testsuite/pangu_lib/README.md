## Pangu

> Pangu (Chinese: Áõ§Âè§, PAN-koo) is a primordial being and creation figure in Chinese mythology who separated heaven [testnet formation] and earth [infrastructure] and became geographic features such as mountains and rivers.

![Pangu](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/1*tOtbmC03M3VBhl32yRo0mg.jpeg)

Pangu is a testnet creation and management CLI, which deploys on top of existing infrastructure.

## What is Pangu CLI?

Ever had to wait for the Velor devnet/testnet releases to test a new feature? Or, create a PR to launch testnets through Forge? Well, these will be a thing of the past with Pangu.

Pangu is a modular, customizable, and next-gen Velor testnet creation-management CLI tool written in Python. Pangu allows you to create, and manage testnets on demand, and blazingly fast üöÄüöÄüöÄ 

Pangu is inherently faster than its predecessors (Forge testnet creation) because:

- Pangu does not use Helm
- Pangu introduces new optimizations using concurrency/parallelism

Also, Pangu‚Äôs source code is significantly easier to read because it is written in strictly-typed Python 3.0, and in a modular manner. 

## Vision

Pangu is meant to be used by researchers/devs that want to create a testnet quickly. But, Pangu also aims to replace how testnets are created and deployed in Forge. 

The Forge integrations are outside of the scope of the initial iteration built by @Olsen Budanur , but (ü§û) Forge will eventually call the Pangu CLI to do testnet creation, and management.

## More Info About the ‚ÄúCreate‚Äù Command

pangu testnet create [OPTIONS] : Creates a testnet with the configurations given in the options in the connected cluster

CREATE OPTIONS:

1. **`-pangu-node-configs-path`**:
    - The Pangu node configs (yaml)

## Pangu Node Config (Customizability)

[Pangu config template](https://github.com/velor-chain/velor-core/blob/main/testsuite/pangu_lib/template_testnet_files/pangu_node_config.yaml)

```yaml
blueprints:
  nodebp: # Must to be all lowercase, and distinct
    validator_config_path: "" # Should provide an absolute path. Can leave empty for the default
    validator_image: "" # Can leave empty for the default
    validator_storage_class_name: "" # Can leave empty for the default
    vfn_config_path: "" # Should provide an absolute path. Use empty str if create_vfns: false. # Can leave empty for the default
    vfn_image: ""  # Can leave empty for the default
    vfn_storage_class_name: "" # Can leave empty for the default
    nodes_persistent_volume_claim_size: "" # Can leave empty for the default
    create_vfns: true # CANNOT BE MODIFIED AFTER DEPLOYMENT
    stake_amount: 100000000000000 # CANNOT BE MODIFIED AFTER DEPLOYMENT
    count: -1 # CANNOT BE MODIFIED AFTER DEPLOYMENT... This is count of validators. In the template, the count doesn't matter as it gets overriden by either the default (10), user's --num-of-validators, or user's custom pangue node config.
  # nodebpexample1: 
  #   validator_config_path: ""
  #   validator_image: "" 
  #   validator_storage_class_name: "" # Can leave empty for the default
  #   vfn_config_path: "" 
  #   vfn_image: ""
  #   nodes_persistent_volume_claim_size: "" # Can leave empty for the default 
  #   create_vfns: false # 
  #   stake_amount: 100000000000000 
  #   count: -1
  # nodebpexample2: 
  #   validator_config_path: ""
  #   validator_image: "" 
  #   validator_storage_class_name: "" # Can leave empty for the default
  #   vfn_config_path: "" 
  #   nodes_persistent_volume_claim_size: "" # Can leave empty for the default 
  #   vfn_image: "" 
  #   vfn_storage_class_name: "" # Can leave empty for the default
  #   create_vfns: false # 
  #   stake_amount: 100000000000000 
  #   count: -1
```

Pangu allows you to use a default template to create n number of nodes without much customization. However, if you want to create a testnet with varying node configurations and pod images, this is also possible through a custom pangu config.

To create a testnet with a custom topology, create a new pangu config file and pass it with the option "--pangu-node-configs-path" 

- [**See the default config here**](https://github.com/velor-chain/velor-core/blob/main/testsuite/pangu_lib/template_testnet_files/pangu_node_config.yaml)
    - The config yaml should start with ‚Äúblueprints:‚Äù
    - A blueprint describes the validator config, the validator image, the vfn config, the vfn image, stake_amount for the validator, and the number of validator/vfn pairs you would like to create with this specific blueprint.
    - The name of the blueprint will dictate the names of the pods (validators, vfns) created using it.
        - A validator created using the bp ‚Äúnodebp‚Äù will be named nodebp-node-{i}-validator (i being the index of the validator. Likewise, a vfn created using the bp ‚Äúnodebp‚Äù will be named nodebp-node-{i}-vfn.
    - You can (and for most cases, should) have multiple blueprints.
- The pangu configs are not only used for creating testnets, but also could be used to update one using the pangu testnet update command. You can change the image, and the node configs of a testnet that is already started by modifying your pangu node configs and using the testnet update command.

## How to Use Pangu

**1-** Have velor-core installed locally, and navigate to the testsuite directory. 

**2-** The entrypoint for all python operations is¬†`[poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)`:

- Install poetry:¬†[https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
- Install poetry deps:¬†`poetry install`

**3-** To set up the pangu alias

```bash
alias pangu="poetry run python pangu.py"
```

**4-** Have a K8s environment set up. For testing purposes, I suggest you use KinD. [Here is a script that can be used to set up KinD.](https://github.com/velor-chain/internal-ops/blob/main/docker/kind/start-kind.sh)

**5-** Use ‚Äúpangu -h‚Äù, ‚Äúpangu node -h‚Äù, and ‚Äúpangu testnet -h‚Äù commands to get more info about the Pangu commands

## Codebase

Pangu lives in velor-core/testsuite. Tips for navigating the codebase:

- [**velor-core/testsuite/pangu.py**](https://github.com/velor-chain/velor-core/blob/main/testsuite/pangu.py)
    - This is the entry point to the Pangu CLI. Use poetry run python pangu.py to run.
- [**velor-core/testsuite/test_framework**](https://github.com/velor-chain/velor-core/tree/main/testsuite/test_framework)
    - Includes the system abstractions for testing.
    - The Kubernetes abstraction might need to be updated to add new Kubernetes features.
- [**velor-core/testsuite/pangu_lib/node_commands**](https://github.com/velor-chain/velor-core/tree/main/testsuite/pangu_lib/node_commands)
    - Includes the commands for the pangu node {COMMAND} commands
    - Each command has its own .py file, which are then aggregated in the commands.py file to be exported to pangu.py
- [a**ptos-core/testsuite/pangu_lib/testnet_commands**](https://github.com/velor-chain/velor-core/tree/main/testsuite/pangu_lib/testnet_commands)
    - Includes the commands for the pangu testnet {COMMAND} commands
    - Each command has its own .py file, which are then aggregated in the commands.py file to be exported to pangu.py
- [**velor-core/testsuite/pangu_lib/tests**](https://github.com/velor-chain/velor-core/tree/main/testsuite/pangu_lib/tests)
    - Includes the unit tests
- [**velor-core/testsuite/pangu-sdk**](https://github.com/velor-chain/velor-core/tree/main/testsuite/pangu-sdk)
    - The Pangu Rust SDK is a light Rust wrapper around the Pangu CLI. It allows rust code to be able to run Pangu commands by passing structs, without having to generate the Pangu Config Yaml files. It is not feature complete, but should be a good starting point for the Pangu-Forge integrations.

## Metrics

@Olsen Budanur tested Pangu‚Äôs performance by creating testsnets of varying sizes in a standard GKE cluster. The table below shows how long it took Pangu to run genesis + apply all the k8s resources. 

Unlike Forge, Pangu was ran from a different cluster than where the testnet is deployed. Thus, it was disadvantaged in that regard during testing.

## Important Notes

- Pangu **DOES NOT** provision infrastructure. Being connected to a K8s cluster is a pre-req to using Pangu. Works with GKE node auto provisioning. 
- If you are getting cryptic errors, comment out the line below ‚ÄúUNCOMMENT FOR MORE VERBOSE ERROR MESSAGES‚Äù on pangu.py for more error information. All exceptions are routed to this code block.
    - You can also set all stream_output‚Äôs in create_testnet.py to be True to get even more logs.
- You should not rely too much on the default move framework mrb, and compile a new version often. An update to the move framework can, and has, break Pangu.
