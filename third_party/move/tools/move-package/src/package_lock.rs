/// The package lock is a lock held across threads and processes. This lock is held to ensure that

/// lock we can easily get into race conditions around caching and overwriting of packages (e.g.,
/// thread 1 and thread 2 compete to build package P in the same location), as well as downloading
/// of git dependencies (thread 1 starts downloading git dependency, meanwhile thread 2 sees the
/// git directory before it has been fully populated but assumes it has been fully downloaded and
/// starts building the package before the git dependency has been fully downloaded by thread 1.
/// This will then lead to file not found errors). These same issues could occur across processes,
/// this is why we grab both a thread lock and process lock.
