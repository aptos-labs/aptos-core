# Unit Testing

* Status: Implemented in Move 1.3

## Introduction

Unit testing is a new feature in Move version 1.3 to allow Move programmers to more easily and concisely test individual functions and features. Previously, the only way to test Move code was using more heavyweight expected-value and transaction-based tests via the Move CLI and Diem functional test framework. Additionally, it was hard — if not impossible — to set up arbitrary state for testing, to test non-public functions, and to have test-only dependencies, functions, and datatypes. With the new Move unit testing feature these are all possible and easy to express.

## Motivation

Being able to test code thoroughly is an essential ability when developing Move code. However, without a unit testing framework for Move, achieving high test coverage for both public and private functions that is clear and easily maintainable is a challenging task.

Move unit tests are written in the module whose functionality they are testing. Because of this, unit tests have access to private functions and can freely construct and publish instances of datatypes defined in the module. This allows a more declarative and transparent style of testing as compared to previous options, where complex sequences of transactions could be needed to set up the state in a specific manner to test a particular code path in a function.

Sometimes there are cross-module data dependencies, functions, or datatypes that you would like to have for testing purposes only. Move unit tests allow expressing that modules, and module members (`use`s, functions, and datatypes) are for testing purposes only. When members are annotated as `#[test_only]` or `#[test]` they will not appear in the compiled bytecode outside of testing. For those familiar with Rust, this is similar to `#[cfg(test)]` and `#[test]` respectively.

## Description

Unit testing for Move adds three new annotations to the Move source language:

* `#[test]`
* `#[test_only]`, and
* `#[expected_failure]`.

They respectively mark a function as a test, mark a module or module member (`use`, function, or struct) as code to be included for testing only, and mark that a test is expected to fail (abort). These annotations can be placed on a function with any visibility. Whenever any module or module member is annotated as `#[test_only]` or `#[test]`, it will not be included in the compiled bytecode unless it is compiled for testing.


### Testing Annotations: Their Meaning and Usage

Both the `#[test]` and `#[expected_failure]` annotations can be used either with or without arguments.

Without arguments, the `#[test]` annotation can only be placed on a function with no parameters. This annotation simply marks this function as a test to be run by the unit testing harness.

```
#[test] // OK
fun this_is_a_test() { ... }

#[test] // Will fail to compile since the test takes an argument
fun this_is_not_correct(arg: signer) { ... }
```

A test can also be annotated as an `#[expected_failure]`. This annotation marks that the annotated test should abort — however the exact abort code is not checked. The test will be marked as failing only if the test fails with a non-abort error, or does not abort. Only functions that have the `#[test]` annotation can also be annotated as an  #`[expected_failure]`.

```
#[test]
#[expected_failure]
public fun this_test_should_abort_and_pass() { abort 1 }

#[test, expected_failure] // Can have multiple in one attribute. This test will pass.
public(script) fun this_other_test_should_abort_and_pass() { abort 1 }
```

With arguments, a test annotation takes the form `#[test(<param_name_1> = <address>, ..., <param_name_n> = <address>)]`. If a function is annotated in such a manner, the function's parameters must be a permutation of the parameters <`param_name_1>, ..., <param_name_n>`, i.e., the order of these parameters as they occur in the function and their order in the test annotation do  not have to be the same, but they must be able to be matched up with each other by name.

Only parameters with a type of `signer` are supported as test parameters. If a non-`signer` parameter is supplied, the test will result in an error when run.

```
#[test(arg = @0xC0FFEE)] // OK
fun this_is_correct_now(arg: signer) { ... }

#[test(wrong_arg_name = @0xC0FFEE)] // Not correct: arg name doesn't match
fun this_is_incorrect(arg: signer) { ... }

#[test(a = @0xC0FFEE, b = @0xCAFE)] // OK. We support multiple signer arguments, but you must always provide a value for that argument
fun this_works(a: signer, b: signer) { ... }

// somewhere a named address is declared
#[test_only] // test-only named addresses are supported
address TEST_NAMED_ADDR = @0x1;
...
#[test(arg = @TEST_NAMED_ADDR)] // Named addresses are supported!
fun this_is_correct_now(arg: signer) { ... }
```

An expected failure annotation can also take the form `#[expected_failure(abort_code = <u64>)]`. If a test function is annotated in such a way, the test must abort with an abort code equal to `<u64>`. Any other failure or abort code will result in a test failure.

```
#[test, expected_failure(abort_code = 1)] // This test will fail
fun this_test_should_abort_and_fail() { abort 0 }

#[test]
#[expected_failure(abort_code = 0)] // This test will pass
fun this_test_should_abort_and_pass_too() { abort 0 }
```

A module and any of its members can be declared as test only. In such a case the item will only be included in the compiled Move bytecode when compiled in test mode. Additionally, when compiled outside of test mode, any non-test `use`s of a `#[test_only]` module will raise an error during compilation.

```
#[test_only] // test only attributes can be attached to modules
module ABC { ... }

#[test_only] // test only attributes can be attached to named addresses
address ADDR = @0x1;

#[test_only] // .. to uses
use 0x1::SomeOtherModule;

#[test_only] // .. to structs
struct SomeStruct { ... }

#[test_only] // .. and functions. Can only be called from test code, but not a test
fun test_only_function(...) { ... }
```

### Running Unit Tests

Unit tests can be compiled and run by the `move-unit-test` crate. It is designed to work out-of-the box, so all you need to start running tests is to pass the files—or directories containing files—that you wish to test (and all dependencies):

```
$ cargo run --bin move-unit-test <move_file_or_dir_containing_move_modules_1> ... <move_file_or_dir_containing_move_modules_n>
```

When running tests, every test will either `PASS`, `FAIL`, or `TIMEOUT`. If a test case fails, the location of the failure along with the function name that caused the failure will be reported if possible. You can see an example of this below.

A test will be marked as timing out if it exceeds the maximum gas that can be executed for any single test. When a gas table is not provided, each bytecode instruction is assigned a gas cost of 1 unit. This bound can be changed using the options below, and its default value is set to 5000 gas units. Additionally, while the result of a test is always deterministic, tests are run in parallel by default, so the ordering of test results in a test run is non-deterministic unless running with only one thread (see `OPTIONS` below).

There are also a number of options that can be passed to the unit testing binary to fine-tune testing, and to help debug failing tests. These are:

```
FLAGS:
        --stackless         Use the stackless bytecode interpreter to run the tests and cross check its results with the
                            execution result from Move VM
    -g, --state_on_error    Show the storage state at the end of execution of a failing test
    -h, --help              Prints help information
    -l, --list              List all tests
    -s, --statistics        Report test statistics at the end of testing
    -V, --version           Prints version information
    -v, --verbose           Verbose mode

OPTIONS:
    -f, --filter <filter>                A filter string to determine which unit tests to run
    -i, --gas_limit <gas_limit>          Bound the amount of gas used by any one test. [default: 1_000_000]
    -t, --threads <num_threads>          Number of threads to use for running tests [default: 8]

ARGS:
    <sources>...    Source files
```

While each of these flags and options are fairly self-explanatory, it is worth mentioning that when filtering tests with the `-f` option, any test whose fully qualified name (i.e., `address::module::function_name`) contains the `<filter>` string will be run.

### Compilation

You should always use the unit testing framework for unit testing Move code. However, there may be times when you may wish to include test-only code outside of unit testing. In such scenarios Move source code can be compiled with test-code included by passing the `--test` flag to the Move compiler.

## Examples

A simple module using some of the unit testing features is shown in the following example:

```
// filename: MyModule.move
module 0x1::MyModule {

    struct MyCoin has key { value: u64 }

    public fun make_sure_non_zero_coin(coin: MyCoin): MyCoin {
        assert(coin.value > 0, 0);
        coin
    }

    public fun has_coin(addr: address): bool {
        exists<MyCoin>(addr)
    }

    #[test]
    fun make_sure_non_zero_coin_passes() {
        let coin = MyCoin { value: 1 };
        let MyCoin { value: _ } = make_sure_non_zero_coin(coin);
    }

    #[test]
    // Or #[expected_failure] if we don't care about the abort code
    #[expected_failure(abort_code = 0)]
    fun make_sure_zero_coin_fails() {
        let coin = MyCoin { value: 0 };
        let MyCoin { value: _ } = make_sure_non_zero_coin(coin);
    }

    #[test_only] // test only helper function
    fun publish_coin(account: &signer) {
        move_to(account, MyCoin { value: 1 })
    }

    #[test(a = @0x1, b = @0x2)]
    fun test_has_coin(a: signer, b: signer) {
        publish_coin(&a);
        publish_coin(&b);
        assert(has_coin(@0x1), 0);
        assert(has_coin(@0x2), 1);
        assert(!has_coin(@0x3), 1);
    }
}
```

### Running Tests

```
$ cargo run --bin move-unit-test MyModule.move
Running Move unit tests
[ PASS    ] 0x1::MyModule::make_sure_non_zero_coin_passes
[ PASS    ] 0x1::MyModule::make_sure_zero_coin_fails
[ PASS    ] 0x1::MyModule::test_has_coin
Test result: OK. Total tests: 3; passed: 3; failed: 0
```

### Using Test Flags

#### `-f <str>` or `--filter <str>`
This will only run tests whose fully qualified name contains `<str>`. For example if we wanted to only run tests with `"zero_coin"` in their name:

```
$ cargo run --bin move-unit-test MyModule.move -f zero_coin
Running Move unit tests
[ PASS    ] 0x1::MyModule::make_sure_non_zero_coin_passes
[ PASS    ] 0x1::MyModule::make_sure_zero_coin_fails
Test result: OK. Total tests: 2; passed: 2; failed: 0
```

#### `-i <bound>` or `--gas_limit <bound>`
This bounds the amount of gas that can be consumed for any one test to `<bound>`:

```
cargo run --bin move-unit-test <dir> -i 0 MyModule.move
Running Move unit tests
[ TIMEOUT ] 0x1::MyModule::make_sure_non_zero_coin_passes
[ TIMEOUT ] 0x1::MyModule::make_sure_zero_coin_fails
[ TIMEOUT ] 0x1::MyModule::test_has_coin

Test failures:

Failures in 0x1::MyModule:

┌── make_sure_non_zero_coin_passes ──────
│ Test timed out
└──────────────────


┌── make_sure_zero_coin_fails ──────
│ Test timed out
└──────────────────


┌── test_has_coin ──────
│ Test timed out
└──────────────────

Test result: FAILED. Total tests: 3; passed: 0; failed: 3
```

#### `-s` or `--statistics`
With these flags you can gather statistics about the tests run and report the runtime and gas used for each test. For example, if we wanted to see the statistics for the tests in the `MyModule` example above:

```
$ cargo run --bin move-unit-test MyModule.move -s
Running tests
[ PASS    ] 0x1::MyModule::make_sure_non_zero_coin_passes
[ PASS    ] 0x1::MyModule::make_sure_zero_coin_fails
[ PASS    ] 0x1::MyModule::test_has_coin

Test Statistics:

┌───────────────────────────────────────────────┬────────────┬───────────────────────────┐
│                   Test Name                   │    Time    │   Gas Used   │
├───────────────────────────────────────────────┼────────────┼───────────────────────────┤
│ 0x1::MyModule::make_sure_non_zero_coin_passes │   0.005    │             1             │
├───────────────────────────────────────────────┼────────────┼───────────────────────────┤
│ 0x1::MyModule::make_sure_zero_coin_fails      │   0.003    │             1             │
├───────────────────────────────────────────────┼────────────┼───────────────────────────┤
│ 0x1::MyModule::test_has_coin                  │   0.004    │             1             │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────┴────────────┴───────────────────────────┘

Test result: OK. Total tests: 3; passed: 3; failed: 0
```

#### `-g` or `--state-on-error`
These flags will print the global state for any test failures. e.g., if we added the following (failing) test to the `MyModule` example:

```
module 0x1::MyModule {
    ...
    #[test(a = @0x1)]
    fun test_has_coin_bad(a: signer) {
        publish_coin(&a);
        assert(has_coin(@0x1), 0);
        assert(has_coin(@0x2), 1);
    }
}
```

we would get the following output:

```
$ cargo run --bin move-unit-test MyModule.move -g
Running tests
[ PASS    ] 0x1::MyModule::make_sure_non_zero_coin_passes
[ PASS    ] 0x1::MyModule::make_sure_zero_coin_fails
[ PASS    ] 0x1::MyModule::test_has_coin
[ FAIL    ] 0x1::MyModule::test_has_coin_bad

Test failures:

```

## Ongoing Work

Support for test-only native functions is currently being added to the unit testing framework. With this addition comes a new way of creating an arbitrary number of `signer` values in test-only code. We expect these features to be available in release 1.4.

We also plan to support running Move unit tests from the Move CLI and expect that this to be supported in release 1.4.

## Alternatives

In the development of unit tests, there were a couple of alternatives considered, some of which you as a Move programmer have at your disposal already, so we highlight the differences here.

### Expected Value Tests

Move already supports [expected value tests](https://github.com/move-language/move/tree/main/language/tools/move-cli#testing-with-the-move-cli) in the Move CLI, however these cover a different aspect of testing for Move. In particular, there is no concept of test-only code and test-only dependencies, which makes testing non-public functions much more difficult. Additionally, each expected value test entry must be a transaction or script function. Because of this, the expected value tests rely on a specific Move adapter implementation, whereas the unit tests do not rely on an adapter implementation and rely solely on the Move compiler and VM.

Due to the design of unit tests, unit tests make it easier to test the individual units of code that comprise a Move module. However, because the unit tests do not require or use an adapter, they do not support certain features that you may  wish to test. E.g., there is no way in Move unit tests to query if a specific event has been emitted.

### Test Modules

The unit tests for Move are function and annotation based: each test and test-only members are declared by attaching an annotation to them. During development we also considered a module-based approach where a separate test module could be declared that contained the tests for a module (and that the compiler would inline so the tests could access private functions and construct datatypes declared in the module). We decided against supporting such an option at this time for simplicity, and to make the additional syntax and the semantics as close as possible to what currently exists in Move, but that option could still be added in the future.
