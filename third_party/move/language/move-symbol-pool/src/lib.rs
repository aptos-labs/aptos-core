//! A global, uniqued cache of strings that is never purged. Inspired by
//! [servo/string-cache].
//!
//! This module provides storage for strings that are meant to remain in use for
//! the entire running duration of a program. Strings that are stored in this
//! global, static cache are never evicted, and so the memory consumed by them
//! can only ever grow.
//!
//! The strings can be accessed via the [`Symbol`] type, which acts as a pointer
//! to the underlying string data.
//!
//! NOTE: If you're looking for a `#[forbid(unsafe_code)]` attribute here, you
//! won't find one: symbol-pool (and its inspiration, servo/string-cache) uses
//! `unsafe` Rust in order to store and dereference `Symbol` pointers to
//! strings.
//!
//! [servo/string-cache]: https://github.com/servo/string-cache
//! [`Symbol`]: crate::Symbol
