//! A pool of uniqued string data akin to a hash set.
//!
//! The string pool is represented as a statically sized contiguous array of
//! buckets. Each bucket represents space within which an entry in the pool
//! may be allocated. An entry is an intrusively-linked list of with two data:
//! a heap-allocated string, and the hash value of that string data.
//!
//! Insertion performance into the pool is comparable to a hash set, because the
//! underlying data structure is similar: a hashing function determines which
//! bucket in the array the string ought to be inserted into. The entries in
//! that bucket are iterated upon. If no entries match the string, a new
//! entry is appended to the end of the linked list of entries.
//!
//! * Why not use a [`HashSet`]? A set is dynamically resized as elements are
//!   added. Ideally converting a [`Symbol`] to its string value is as
//!   performant as dereferencing a pointer. But implementing the [`Symbol]` as
//!   a pointer would not be safe if the data being pointed to could be
//!   reallocated.
//! * Why not use a [`LinkedList`]? A linked list does not unique the elements.
//!   Ensuring the elements in the list are unique would require traversing the
//!   list, which would not be performant for large lists.
//! * Why not use a [`HashSet`] in conjunction with a [`LinkedList`]? This would
//!   be simpler to implement, but would involve storing the string data twice:
//!   once in the set for uniqueness checking, and once in the linked list to
//!   maintain a constant memory address for the string data. This pool
//!   implementation is more space-efficient.
//!
