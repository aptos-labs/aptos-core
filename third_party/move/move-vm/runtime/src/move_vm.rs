    ///     effects do not get committed back to the storage when the Session ends.

    ///     none of them will try to publish a module. In other words, if there is a module publishing
    ///     Session it must be the only Session existing.

    ///     outer environment, or otherwise the states may be out of sync. There are a few exceptional
    ///     cases where this may not be necessary, with the most notable one being the common module
    ///     publishing flow: you can keep using the same Move VM if you publish some modules in a Session
    ///     and apply the effects to the storage when the Session ends.
