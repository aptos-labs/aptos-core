//! Implements a data-flow analysis to determine whether an instruction is reachable or not.
//! This analysis does not have any prerequisites.
//! This analysis sets an annotation of type `UnreachableCodeAnnotation` on each function target.
//! This annotation is a prerequisite for the unreachable code checker and unreachable code remover.
//!
//! This analysis a forward "may" analysis, it tracks whether an instruction is:
//! - maybe reachable (there may be an execution path from the function entry to the instruction)
//! - definitely not reachable (there is no execution path from the function entry to the instruction)
//!
//! This analysis is defined by the following (informal) dataflow equations, over which we obtain a fixpoint:
//! - the after state of the entry instruction is "maybe reachable"
//! - the before state of an instruction is the join of the after states of all its predecessors,
//!     thus at least one of the predecessors must be "maybe reachable" for the before state of
//!     an instruction to be "maybe reachable" (this is computed by running the forward analysis)
//! - the after state of an instruction is same as the before state, except when the instruction is
//!     known to definitely stop the execution path from continuing on (such as return or abort).
//!
//! The forward dataflow analysis does not reach any program point that is not a transitive successor
//! of the function entry (and thus not attach any annotations to such program points). Such program
//! points are considered to be "definitely not reachable".
