//! Implements the "dead store elimination" transformation.
//!
//! This transformation should be run after the variable coalescing transformation,
//! as it removes the dead stores that variable coalescing may introduce.
//!
//! Prerequisite: the `LiveVarAnnotation` should already be computed by running the
//! `LiveVarAnalysisProcessor` in the `track_all_usages` mode.
//! Side effect: all annotations will be removed from the function target annotations.
//!
//! Given live variables and all their usages at each program point,
//! this transformation removes dead stores, i.e., assignments and loads to locals which
//! are not live afterwards (or are live only in dead code, making them effectively dead).
//! In addition, it also removes self-assignments, i.e., assignments of the form `x = x`.
//! One can also remove only those self-assignments where the definition is in the same block
//! before the self-assign by using `eliminate_all_self_assigns=false`.

/// - each forward edge `a -> b` has a corresponding backward edge (`parents`) `a <- b`.
