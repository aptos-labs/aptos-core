//! This module contains a window peephole optimizer for the Move bytecode.
//! As with all peephole optimizers here, it assumes that the bytecode is valid.
//!
//! We consider fixed windows of size 2 for this optimizer.
//!
//! To reason about the correctness of the optimizations, we need to think about the
//! effect on (1) the stack, (2) the locals, (3) control flow behavior.
//!
//! Below are the implemented optimizations (which all retain the control flow behavior):
//! 1. `StLoc` and `MoveLoc` of the same local `l`: Remove the pair.
//!    - stack is left unaffected (the top remains the same)
//!    - local `l` would not be accessed again (without a future store), because before
//!      the transformation, the value in it has been moved from, leaving it invalid.
//! 2. `CopyLoc` and `StLoc` of the same local `l`: Remove the pair.
//!    - stack is left unaffected
//!    - local `l` has the same valid value as before.
//! 3. `MoveLoc` and `StLoc` of the same local `l`: Remove the pair.
//!    - stack is left unaffected
//!    - local `l` has the same valid value as before.
//! 4. `CopyLoc` followed by `Pop`: Remove the pair.
//!    - stack is left unaffected (value is copied to the top and then removed)
//!    - local is unaffected: it still has a valid value because of copy.
//! 5. [`LdTrue`, `BrTrue`] or [`LdFalse`, `BrFalse`]: Replace with `Branch` to the same
//!    target.
//!    - stack is left unaffected (the first instruction pushes a constant, the second
//!      takes it off).
//! 6. [`LdTrue`, `BrFalse`] or [`LdFalse`, `BrTrue`]: Remove the pair.
//!    - stack is left unaffected.
//!    - locals are unaffected.
//!    - basic blocks are merged.
//! 7. [`Not`, `BrFalse`] or [`Not`, `BrTrue`]: Replace with `BrTrue` or `BrFalse`.
//!    - stack is left unaffected (first instruction negates the top, second takes it
//!      off, vs. just take off the top).
//!    - locals are unaffected.
//!
//! Finally, note that fixed window optimizations are performed on windows within a basic
//! block, not spanning across multiple basic blocks.
