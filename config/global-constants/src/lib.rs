//! The purpose of this crate is to offer a single source of truth for the definitions of shared
//! constants within the codebase. This is useful because many different components within
//! Aptos often require access to global constant definitions (e.g., Safety Rules,
//! Key Manager, and Secure Storage). To avoid duplicating these definitions across crates
//! (and better allow these constants to be updated in a single location), we define them here.
