# Git Helper

## Overview

[TODO: 1-2 sentences explaining what this skill enables]

## Structuring This Skill

[TODO: Choose the structure that best fits this skill's purpose. Common patterns:

**1. Workflow-Based** (best for sequential processes)
- Works well when there are clear step-by-step procedures
- Example: CSV-Processor skill with "Workflow Decision Tree" → "Ingestion" → "Cleaning" → "Analysis"
- Structure: ## Overview → ## Workflow Decision Tree → ## Step 1 → ## Step 2...

**2. Task-Based** (best for tool collections)
- Works well when the skill offers different operations/capabilities
- Example: PDF skill with "Quick Start" → "Merge PDFs" → "Split PDFs" → "Extract Text"
- Structure: ## Overview → ## Quick Start → ## Task Category 1 → ## Task Category 2...

**3. Reference/Guidelines** (best for standards or specifications)
- Works well for brand guidelines, coding standards, or requirements
- Example: Brand styling with "Brand Guidelines" → "Colors" → "Typography" → "Features"
- Structure: ## Overview → ## Guidelines → ## Specifications → ## Usage...

**4. Capabilities-Based** (best for integrated systems)
- Works well when the skill provides multiple interrelated features
- Example: Product Management with "Core Capabilities" → numbered capability list
- Structure: ## Overview → ## Core Capabilities → ### 1. Feature → ### 2. Feature...

Patterns can be mixed and matched as needed. Most skills combine patterns (e.g., start with task-based, add workflow for complex operations).

Delete this entire "Structuring This Skill" section when done - it's just guidance.]

## [TODO: Replace with the first main section based on chosen structure]

[TODO: Add content here. See examples in existing skills:
- Code samples for technical skills
- Decision trees for complex workflows
- Concrete examples with realistic user requests
- References to scripts/templates/references as needed]

## Resources

This skill includes example resource directories that demonstrate how to organize different types of bundled resources:

### scripts/
Executable code that can be run directly to perform specific operations.

**Examples from other skills:**
- PDF skill: fill_fillable_fields.cjs, extract_form_field_info.cjs - utilities for PDF manipulation
- CSV skill: normalize_schema.cjs, merge_datasets.cjs - utilities for tabular data manipulation

**Appropriate for:** Node.cjs scripts (cjs), shell scripts, or any executable code that performs automation, data processing, or specific operations.

**Note:** Scripts may be executed without loading into context, but can still be read by Gemini CLI for patching or environment adjustments.

### references/
Documentation and reference material intended to be loaded into context to inform Gemini CLI's process and thinking.

**Examples from other skills:**
- Product management: communication.md, context_building.md - detailed workflow guides
- BigQuery: API reference documentation and query examples
- Finance: Schema documentation, company policies

**Appropriate for:** In-depth documentation, API references, database schemas, comprehensive guides, or any detailed information that Gemini CLI should reference while working.

### assets/
Files not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Gemini CLI produces.

**Examples from other skills:**
- Brand styling: PowerPoint template files (.pptx), logo files
- Frontend builder: HTML/React boilerplate project directories
- Typography: Font files (.ttf, .woff2)

**Appropriate for:** Templates, boilerplate code, document templates, images, icons, fonts, or any files meant to be copied or used in the final output.

**Any unneeded directories can be deleted.** Not every skill requires all three types of resources.
