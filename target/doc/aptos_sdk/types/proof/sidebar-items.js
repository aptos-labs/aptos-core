For example, at some point in time a client knows that the root hash of the ledger at version 10 is `old_root` (it could be a waypoint). If a server wants to prove that the new ledger at version `N` is derived from the old ledger the client knows, it can show the subtrees that represent all the new leaves. If the client can verify that it can indeed obtain the new root hash by appending these new leaves, it can be convinced that the two accumulators are consistent."],["AccumulatorExtensionProof","A proof that first verifies that establishes correct computation of the root and then returns the new tree to acquire a new root and version."],["AccumulatorProof","A proof that can be used authenticate an element in an accumulator given trusted root hash.
