\begin{abstract}
  The Move Prover (\MVP) is a formal verifier for smart contracts
  written in the Move programming language. \MVP has an expressive
  specification language, and is fast and reliable enough that it can
  be run routinely by developers and in integration testing in a few
  minutes. Besides the simplicity of smart contracts and the Move
  language, three transformations are responsible for the practicality
  of \MVP: (1) an alias-free memory model, (2) fine-grained invariant
  checking, and (3) monomorphization.  The entirety of the Move code for
  the Diem blockchain has been extensively specified and can be
  completely verified by \MVP in a few minutes. Changes in the Diem
  framework must be successfully verified before being integrated into
  the open source repository on GitHub.
