/// An example of a decentralized lottery that picks its winner based on randomness generated in the future
/// by the drand randomnes beacon.
///
/// **WARNING #1:** This example has not been audited and should thus NOT be relied upon as an authoritative guide on
/// using `drand` randomness safely in Move.
///
/// WARNING #2: This code makes a STRONG assumption that the Aptos clock and the drand clock are synchronized.
/// In practice, the Aptos clock could be lagging behind. As an example, even though the current time is Friday, July
/// 14th, 2023, 7:34PM, from the perspective of the blockchain validators, the time could be Thursday, July 13th, 2023.
/// (Exaggerating the difference, to make the point clearer.) Therefore, a drand round for noon at Friday would be
/// incorrectly treated as a valid future drand round, even though that round has passed. It is therefore important that
/// contracts account for any drift between the Aptos clock and the drand clock. In this example, this can be done by
/// increasing the MINIMUM_LOTTERY_DURATION_SECS to account for this drift.
