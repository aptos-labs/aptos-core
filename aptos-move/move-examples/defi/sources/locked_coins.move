/**
 * This provides an example for sending locked coins to recipients to be unlocked after a specific time.
 *
 * Locked coins flow:
 * 1. Deploy the lockup contract. Deployer can decide if the contract is upgradable or not.
 * 2. Sponsor accounts (sponsors) call initialize_sponsor with the appropriate CoinType to set up their account for
 * creating locks later.
 * 2. Sponsors add locked APTs for custom expiration time + amount for recipients. Each lockup is called a "lock".
 * 3. Sponsors can revoke a lock or change lockup (reduce or extend) anytime. This gives flexibility in case of
 * contract violation or special circumstances. If this is not desired, the deployer can remove these functionalities
 * before deploying. If a lock is canceled, the locked coins will be sent back to the withdrawal address. This
 * withdrawal address is set when initilizing the sponsor account and can only be changed when there are no active or
 * unclaimed locks.
 * 4. Once the lockup has expired, the recipient can call claim to get the unlocked tokens.
