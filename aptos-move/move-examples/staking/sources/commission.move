/// This contract is used to manage the commission rate for the node operator. There are two entities involved:
/// 1. Manager: The account that can set the commission rate and change the operator account.
/// 2. Operator: The account that receives the commission in dollars in exchange for running the node.
///
/// The commission rate is set in dollars and will be used to determine how much APT the operator receives.
/// The commission is distributed to the operator and remaining amount to the manager. If there's not enough balance
/// to pay the commission, either commission rate is set too high or APT price is low. In this case, the commission
/// debt will be updated and the operator will receive the remaining balance in the next distribution.
///
/// Important notes:
///
/// 1. There are rounding errors that can lead to 1 octa (1e-8 APT) and $1 rounding errors on conversions during
/// distribution. Although the commission amount can be adjusted to make up for these rounding errors for operators,
/// developers using this contract can also add decimals to the dollar amount (e.g. 2 decimals) to reduce the rounding
/// errors.
/// 2. In theory this function can be called very often (e.g. once every few seconds) to use rounding errors
/// to "rob" the operator because micro amounts are rounded to 0. This is not possible in practice when using this
/// contract for node operator commission as it's only paid out once in a while (at least a few days) so balance is
/// zero before then which makes the attack not possible.
