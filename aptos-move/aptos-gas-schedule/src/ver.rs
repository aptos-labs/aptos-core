///   - New gas parameters being added, removed or renamed
///   - Changing how gas is calculated in any way
///
/// Change log:
/// - V23
///   - Introduced eth_trie_proof* gas-schedule parameters utilized in native crypto function
///     referenced from `0x1::supra_std::eth_trie`
/// - V22
///   - Increased governance transaction execution limit from 4B to 5B to enable framework upgrades without changing
///     the gas schedule.
///   - Updated the `pbo_delegation_pool.move` and `vesting_without_staking.move` smart contracts (not gas-related).
/// - V21
///   - Fix type to type tag conversion in MoveVM
/// - V20
///   - Limits for bounding MoveVM type sizes
/// - V19
///   - Gas for aggregator_v2::is_at_least native function
/// - V18
///   - Separate limits for governance scripts
///   - Function info & dispatchable token gas params
/// - V17
///   - Gas for keyless
/// - V16
///   - IO Gas for the transaction itself and events in the transaction output
/// - V15
///   - Gas & limits for dependencies
/// - V14
///   - Gas for type creation
///   - Storage Fee: Make state bytes refundable and remove the per slot free quota, gated by flag REFUNDABLE_BYTES
/// - V13
///   (skipped due to testnet mis-operation)
/// - V12
///   - Added BN254 operations.
///   - IO gas change: 1. read bytes charged at 4KB intervals; 2. ignore free_write_bytes_quota
///   - aggregator v2 gas charges
/// - V11
///   - Ristretto255 natives (point cloning & double-scalar multiplication) and Bulletproofs natives
///   - Hard limit on the number of write ops per transaction
/// - V10
///   - Added generate_unique_address and get_txn_hash native functions
///   - Storage gas charges (excluding "storage fees") stop respecting the storage gas curves
/// - V9
///   - Accurate tracking of the cost of loading resource groups
/// - V8
///   - Added BLS12-381 operations.
/// - V7
///   - Native support for `exists<T>`
///   - New formulae for storage fees based on fixed SUPRA costs
///   - Lower gas price (other than the newly introduced storage fees) by upping the scaling factor
/// - V6
///   - Added a new native function - blake2b_256.
/// - V5
///   - u16, u32, u256
///   - free_write_bytes_quota
///   - configurable ChangeSetConfigs
/// - V4
///   - Consider memory leaked for event natives
/// - V3
///   - Add memory quota
///   - Storage charges:
///     - Distinguish between new and existing resources
///     - One item write comes with 1K free bytes
///     - abort with STORAGE_WRITE_LIMIT_REACHED if WriteOps or Events are too large
/// - V2
///   - Table
///     - Fix the gas formula for loading resources so that they are consistent with other
///       global operations.
/// - V1
///   - TBA
