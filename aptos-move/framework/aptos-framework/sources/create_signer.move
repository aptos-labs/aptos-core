/// To use create_signer, add the module below, such that:

/// where `friend_wants_create_signer` is the module that needs `create_signer`.
///
/// Note, that this is only available within the Aptos Framework.

/// This exists to make auditing straight forward and to limit the need to depend
/// on account to have access to this.
