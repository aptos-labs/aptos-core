///
/// Simple vesting contract that allows specifying how much APT coins should be vesting in each fixed-size period. The
/// vesting contract also comes with staking and allows shareholders to withdraw rewards anytime.
///
/// Vesting schedule is represented as a vector of distributions. For example, a vesting schedule of
/// [3/48, 3/48, 1/48] means that after the vesting starts:
/// 1. The first and second periods will vest 3/48 of the total original grant.
/// 2. The third period will vest 1/48.
/// 3. All subsequent periods will also vest 1/48 (last distribution in the schedule) until the original grant runs out.
///
/// Shareholder flow:
/// 1. Admin calls create_vesting_contract with a schedule of [3/48, 3/48, 1/48] with a vesting cliff of 1 year and
/// vesting period of 1 month.
/// 2. After a month, a shareholder calls unlock_rewards to request rewards. They can also call vest() which would also
/// unlocks rewards but since the 1 year cliff has not passed (vesting has not started), vest() would not release any of
/// the original grant.
/// 3. After the unlocked rewards become fully withdrawable (as it's subject to staking lockup), shareholders can call
/// distribute() to send all withdrawable funds to all shareholders based on the original grant's shares structure.
/// 4. After 1 year and 1 month, the vesting schedule now starts. Shareholders call vest() to unlock vested coins. vest()
/// checks the schedule and unlocks 3/48 of the original grant in addition to any accumulated rewards since last
/// unlock_rewards(). Once the unlocked coins become withdrawable, shareholders can call distribute().
/// 5. Assuming the shareholders forgot to call vest() for 2 months, when they call vest() again, they will unlock vested
/// tokens for the next period since last vest. This would be for the first month they missed. They can call vest() a
/// second time to unlock for the second month they missed.
///
/// Admin flow:
/// 1. After creating the vesting contract, admin cannot change the vesting schedule.
/// 2. Admin can call update_voter, update_operator, or reset_lockup at any time to update the underlying staking
/// contract.
/// 3. Admin can also call update_beneficiary for any shareholder. This would send all distributions (rewards, vested
/// coins) of that shareholder to the beneficiary account. By defalt, if a beneficiary is not set, the distributions are
/// send directly to the shareholder account.
/// 4. Admin can call terminate_vesting_contract to terminate the vesting. This would first finish any distribution but
/// will prevent any further rewards or vesting distributions from being created. Once the locked up stake becomes
/// withdrawable, admin can call admin_withdraw to withdraw all funds to the vesting contract's withdrawal address.
