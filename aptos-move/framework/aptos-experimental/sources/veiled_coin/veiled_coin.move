/// **WARNING:** This is an **experimental, proof-of-concept** module! It is *NOT* production-ready and it will likely
/// lead to loss of funds if used (or misused).
///
/// This module provides a veiled coin type, denoted `VeiledCoin<T>` that hides the value/denomination of a coin.
/// Importantly, although veiled transactions hide the amount of coins sent they still leak the sender and recipient.
///
/// ## How to use veiled coins
///
/// This module allows users to "register" a veiled account for any pre-existing `aptos_framework::Coin` type `T` via
/// the `register` entry function. For this, an encryption public key will need to be given as input, under which
/// the registered user's veiled balance will be encrypted.
///
/// Once Alice registers a veiled account for `T`, she can call `veil` with any public amount `a` of `T` coins
/// and add them to her veiled balance. Note that these coins will not be properly veiled yet, since they were withdrawn
/// from a public balance, which leaks their value.
///
/// (Alternatively, another user can initialize Alice's veiled balance by calling `veil_to`.)
///
/// Suppose Bob also registers and veils `b` of his own coins of type `T`.
///
/// Now Alice can use `fully_veiled_transfer` to send to Bob a secret amount `v` of coins from her veiled balance.
/// This will, for the first time, properly hide both Alice's and Bob's veiled balance.
/// The only information that an attacker (e.g., an Aptos validator) learns, is that Alice transferred an unknown amount
/// `v` to Bob (including $v=0$), and as a result Alice's veiled balance is in a range [a-v, a] and Bob's veiled balance
/// is in [b, b+v]`.
///
/// As more veiled transfers occur between more veiled accounts, the uncertainity on the balance of each account becomes
/// larger and larger.
///
/// Lastly, users can easily withdraw veiled coins back into their public balance via `unveil`. Or, they can withdraw
/// publicly into someone else's public balance via `unveil_to`.
///
/// ## Terminology
///
/// 1. *Veiled coin*: a coin whose value is secret; i.e., it is encrypted under the owner's public key.
///
/// 2. *Veiled amount*: any amount that is secret because it was encrypted under some public key.
/// 3. *Committed amount*: any amount that is secret because it was committed to (rather than encrypted).
///
/// 4. *Veiled transaction*: a transaction that hides its amount transferred; i.e., a transaction whose amount is veiled.
///
/// 5. *Veiled balance*: unlike a normal balance, a veiled balance is secret; i.e., it is encrypted under the account's
///    public key.
///
/// 6. *ZKRP*: zero-knowledge range proofs; one of the key cryptographic ingredient in veiled coins which ensures users
///    can withdraw secretely from their veiled balance without over-withdrawing.
///
/// ## Limitations
///
/// **WARNING:** This module is **experimental**! It is *NOT* production-ready. Specifically:
///
///  1. Deploying this module will likely lead to lost funds.
///  2. This module has not been cryptographically-audited.
///  3. The current implementation is vulnerable to _front-running attacks_ as described in the Zether paper [BAZB20].
///  4. There is no integration with wallet software which, for veiled accounts, must maintain an additional ElGamal
///    encryption keypair.
///  5. There is no support for rotating the ElGamal encryption public key of a veiled account.
///
/// ## Veiled coin amounts as truncated `u32`'s
///
/// Veiled coin amounts must be specified as `u32`'s rather than `u64`'s as would be typical for normal coins in the
/// Aptos framework. This is because coin amounts must be encrypted with an *efficient*, additively-homomorphic encryption
/// scheme. Currently, our best candidate is ElGamal encryption in the exponent, which can only decrypt values around
/// 32 bits or slightly larger.
///
/// Specifically, veiled coin amounts are restricted to be 32 bits and can be cast to a normal 64-bit coin value by
/// setting the leftmost and rightmost 16 bits to zero and the "middle" 32 bits to be the veiled coin bits.
///
/// This gives veiled amounts ~10 bits for specifying ~3 decimals and ~22 bits for specifying whole amounts, which
/// limits veiled balances and veiled transfers to around 4 million coins. (See `coin.move` for how a normal 64-bit coin
/// value gets interpreted as a decimal number.)
///
/// In order to convert a `u32` veiled coin amount to a normal `u64` coin amount, we have to shift it left by 16 bits.
///
/// ```
/// u64 normal coin amount format:
/// [ left    || middle  || right ]
/// [ 63 - 32 || 31 - 16 || 15 - 0]
///
/// u32 veiled coin amount format; we take the middle 32 bits from the u64 format above and store them in a u32:
/// [ middle ]
/// [ 31 - 0 ]
/// ```
///
/// Recall that: A coin has a *decimal precision* $d$ (e.g., for `AptosCoin`, $d = 8$; see `initialize` in
/// `aptos_coin.move`). This precision $d$ is used when displaying a `u64` amount, by dividing the amount by $10^d$.
/// For example, if the precision $d = 2$, then a `u64` amount of 505 coins displays as 5.05 coins.
///
/// For veiled coins, we can easily display a `u32` `Coin<T>` amount $v$ by:
///  1. Casting $v$ as a u64 and shifting this left by 16 bits, obtaining a 64-bit $v'$
///  2. Displaying $v'$ normally, by dividing it by $d$, which is the precision in `CoinInfo<T>`.
///
/// ## Implementation details
///
/// This module leverages a so-called "resource account," which helps us mint a `VeiledCoin<T>` from a
/// normal `coin::Coin<T>` by transferring this latter coin into a `coin::CoinStore<T>` stored in the
/// resource account.
///
/// Later on, when someone wants to convert their `VeiledCoin<T>` into a normal `coin::Coin<T>`,
/// the resource account can be used to transfer out the normal from its coin store. Transferring out a coin like this
/// requires a `signer` for the resource account, which the `veiled_coin` module can obtain via a `SignerCapability`.

        //
        //  3. We verify a ZK range proof that `new_bal \in [0, 2^{32})`. Otherwise, a sender could set `amount = bal + 1`,
        //     which would satisfy condition (2) from above but would give `new_bal = bal - (bal + 1) = -1`. Therefore,
