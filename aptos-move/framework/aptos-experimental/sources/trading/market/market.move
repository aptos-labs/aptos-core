/// This module provides a generic trading engine implementation for a market. On a high level, its a data structure,
/// that stores an order book and provides APIs to place orders, cancel orders, and match orders. The market also acts
/// as a wrapper around the order book and pluggable clearinghouse implementation.
/// A clearing house implementation is expected to implement the following APIs
///  - settle_trade(taker, maker, taker_order_id, maker_order_id, fill_id, is_taker_long, price, size): SettleTradeResult ->
/// Called by the market when there is an match between taker and maker. The clearinghouse is expected to settle the trade
/// and return the result. Please note that the clearing house settlment size might not be the same as the order match size and
/// the settlement might also fail. The fill_id is an incremental counter for matched orders and can be used to track specific fills
///  - validate_order_placement(account, is_taker, is_long, price, size): bool -> Called by the market to validate
///  an order when its placed. The clearinghouse is expected to validate the order and return true if the order is valid.
///  Checkout clearinghouse_test as an example of the simplest form of clearing house implementation that just tracks
///  the position size of the user and does not do any validation.
///
/// - place_maker_order(account, order_id, is_bid, price, size, metadata) -> Called by the market before placing the
/// maker order in the order book. The clearinghouse can use this to track pending orders in the order book and perform
/// any other book keeping operations.
///
/// - cleanup_order(account, order_id, is_bid, remaining_size) -> Called by the market when an order is cancelled or fully filled
/// The clearinhouse can perform any cleanup operations like removing the order from the pending orders list. For every order placement
/// that passes the validate_order_placement check,
/// the market guarantees that the cleanup_order API will be called once and only once with the remaining size of the order.
///
/// - decrease_order_size(account, order_id, is_bid, price, size) -> Called by the market when a maker order is decreased
/// in size by the user. Please note that this API will only be called after place_maker_order is called and the order is
/// already in the order book. Size in this case is the remaining size of the order after the decrease.
///
/// Following are some valid sequence of API calls that the market makes to the clearinghouse:
/// 1. validate_order_placement(10)
/// 2. settle_trade(2)
/// 3. settle_trade(3)
/// 4. place_maker_order(5)
/// 5. decrease_order_size(2)
/// 6. decrease_order_size(1)
/// 7. cleanup_order(2)
/// or
/// 1. validate_order_placement(10)
/// 2. cleanup_order(10)
///
/// Upon placement of an order, the market generates an order id and emits an event with the order details - the order id
/// is a unique id for the order that can be used to later get the status of the order or cancel the order.
///
/// Market also supports various conditions for order matching like Good Till Cancelled (GTC), Post Only, Immediate or Cancel (IOC).
/// GTC orders are orders that are valid until they are cancelled or filled. Post Only orders are orders that are valid only if they are not
/// taker orders. IOC orders are orders that are valid only if they are taker orders.
///
/// In addition, the market also supports trigger conditions for orders. An order with trigger condition is not put
/// on the order book until its trigger conditions are met. Following trigger conditions are supported:
/// TakeProfit(price): If its a buy order its triggered when the market price is greater than or equal to the price. If
/// its a sell order its triggered when the market price is less than or equal to the price.
/// StopLoss(price): If its a buy order its triggered when the market price is less than or equal to the price. If its
/// a sell order its triggered when the market price is greater than or equal to the price.
/// TimeBased(time): The order is triggered when the current time is greater than or equal to the time.
