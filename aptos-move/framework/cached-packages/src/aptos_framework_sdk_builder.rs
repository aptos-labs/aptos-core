/// demonstrating that the user intends to and has the capability to rotate the authentication key of this account;
/// - the second signature `cap_update_table` refers to the signature by the new key (that the account owner wants to rotate to) on a
/// valid `RotationProofChallenge`, demonstrating that the user owns the new private key, and has the authority to update the
/// `OriginatingAddress` map with the new address mapping `<new_address, originating_address>`.
/// To verify these two signatures, we need their corresponding public key and public key scheme: we use `from_scheme` and `from_public_key_bytes`
/// to verify `cap_rotate_key`, and `to_scheme` and `to_public_key_bytes` to verify `cap_update_table`.

/// Alice has rotated her account `addr_a` to `new_addr_a`. As a result, the following entry is created, to help Alice when recovering her wallet:
/// `OriginatingAddress[new_addr_a]` -> `addr_a`
/// Alice has had a bad day: her laptop blew up and she needs to reset her account on a new one.

/// Bob creates an account `addr_b` and maliciously rotates it to Alice's new address `new_addr_a`. Since we are no longer checking a PoK,
/// Bob can easily do this.
///
/// Now, the table will be updated to make Alice's new address point to Bob's address: `OriginatingAddress[new_addr_a]` -> `addr_b`.
/// When Alice recovers her account, her wallet will display the attacker's address (Bob's) `addr_b` as her address.
/// Now Alice will give `addr_b` to everyone to pay her, but the money will go to Bob.
