/////////////////////////////// Explanation for ExecutionStatus ///////////////////////////////
/// All possible execution status for each transaction. In the explanation below, we abbreviate
/// 'execution status' as 'status'. Each status contains the latest incarnation number,
/// where incarnation = i means it is the i-th execution instance of the transaction.
///
/// 'Ready' means that the corresponding incarnation should be executed and the scheduler
/// must eventually create a corresponding execution task. The scheduler ensures that exactly one
/// execution task gets created, changing the status to 'Executing' in the process. 'Ready' status
/// contains an ExecutionTaskType, which is either Execution or Wakeup. If it is Execution, then
/// the scheduler creates an execution task for the corresponding incarnation. If it is Wakeup,
/// a dependency condition variable is set in ExecutionTaskType::Wakeup(DependencyCondvar): an execution
/// of a prior incarnation is waiting on it with a read dependency resolved (when dependency was
/// encountered, the status changed to Suspended, and suspended changed to Ready when the dependency
/// finished its execution). In this case the caller need not create a new execution task, but
/// just notify the suspended execution via the dependency condition variable.
///
/// 'Executing' status of an incarnation turns into 'Executed' if the execution task finishes, or
/// if a dependency is encountered, it becomes 'Ready(incarnation)' once the
/// dependency is resolved. An 'Executed' status allows creation of validation tasks for the
/// corresponding incarnation, and a validation failure leads to an abort. The scheduler ensures
/// that there is exactly one abort, changing the status to 'Aborting' in the process. Once the
/// thread that successfully aborted performs everything that's required, it sets the status
/// to 'Ready(incarnation + 1)', allowing the scheduler to create an execution
/// task for the next incarnation of the transaction.
///
/// 'ExecutionHalted' is a transaction status marking that parallel execution is halted, due to
/// reasons such as module r/w intersection or exceeding per-block gas limit. It is safe to ignore
/// this status during the transaction invariant checks, e.g., suspend(), resume(), set_executed_status().

/////////////////////////////// Explanation for ValidationStatus ///////////////////////////////
/// All possible validation status for each transaction. In the explanation below, we abbreviate
/// 'validation status' as 'status'. Each status contains three wave numbers, each with different
/// meanings, but in general the concept of 'wave' keeps track of the version number of the validation.
///
/// 'max_triggered_wave' records the maximum wave that was triggered at the transaction index, and
/// will be incremented every time when the validation_idx is decreased. Initialized as 0.
///
/// 'maybe_max_validated_wave' records the maximum wave among successful validations of the corresponding
/// transaction, will be incremented upon successful validation (finish_validation). Initialized as None.
///
/// 'required_wave' in addition records the wave that must be successfully validated in order
/// for the transaction to be committed, required to handle the case of the optimization in
/// finish_execution when only the transaction itself is validated (if last incarnation
/// didn't write outside of the previous write-set). Initialized as 0.
///
/// Other than ValidationStatus, the 'wave' information is also recorded in 'validation_idx' and 'commit_state'.
/// Below is the description of the wave meanings and how they are updated. More details can be
/// found in the definition of 'validation_idx' and 'commit_state'.
///
/// In 'validation_idx', the first 32 bits identifies a validation wave while the last 32 bits
/// contain an index that tracks the minimum of all transaction indices that require validation.
/// The wave is incremented whenever the validation_idx is reduced due to transactions requiring
/// validation, in particular, after aborts and executions that write outside of the write set of
/// the same transaction's previous incarnation.
///
/// In 'commit_state', the first element records the next transaction to commit, and the
/// second element records the lower bound on the wave of a validation that must be successful
/// in order to commit the next transaction. The wave is updated in try_commit, upon seeing an
/// executed txn with higher max_triggered_wave. Note that the wave is *not* updated with the
/// required_wave of the txn that is being committed.
///
///
/////////////////////////////// Algorithm Description for Updating Waves ///////////////////////////////
/// In the following, 'update' means taking the maximum.
/// (1) Upon decreasing validation_idx, increment validation_idx.wave and update txn's
/// max_triggered_wave <- validation_idx.wave;
/// (2) Upon finishing execution of txn that is below validation_idx, update txn's
/// required_wave <- validation_idx.wave; (otherwise, the last triggered wave is below and will validate).
/// (3) Upon validating a txn successfully, update txn's maybe_max_validated_wave <- validation_idx.wave;
/// (4) Upon trying to commit an executed txn, update commit_state.wave <- txn's max_triggered_wave.
/// (5) If txn's maybe_max_validated_wave >= max(commit_state.wave, txn's required_wave), can commit the txn.
///
/// Remark: commit_state.wave is updated only with max_triggered_wave but not required_wave. This is
/// because max_triggered_wave implies that this wave of validations was required for all higher transactions
/// (and is set as a part of decrease_validation_idx), while required_wave is set for the transaction only
/// (when a validation task is returned to the caller). Moreover, the code is structured in a way that
/// decrease_validation_idx is always called for txn_idx + 1 (e.g. when aborting, there is no need to validate
/// the transaction before re-execution, and in finish_execution, even if there is a need to validate txn_idx,
/// it is returned to the caller directly, which is done so as an optimization and also for uniformity).
