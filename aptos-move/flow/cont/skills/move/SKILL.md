# Move on Aptos

Move is a safe, resource-oriented programming language for smart contracts on the
Aptos blockchain. It uses a linear type system to enforce ownership and prevent
double-spending at compile time.

Key concepts: modules, structs, resources, abilities (`key`, `store`, `copy`, `drop`),
entry functions, and the global storage model.
