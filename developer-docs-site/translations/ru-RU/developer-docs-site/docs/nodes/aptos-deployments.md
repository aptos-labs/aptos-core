| Description                                                 | Aptos Devnet                                                                                           | Local Testnet                                                                                                | Aptos Incentivized Testnet (AIT)                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| **Network runs where**                                      | Validators run on Aptos servers. FullNodes are run by both Aptos and you (i.e., the Aptos community).  | Validators and FullNodes run locally on your computer, entirely independent from devnet.                     | Some Validators run on Aptos servers, others are run by the Aptos community. FullNodes are run by Aptos and the community.                                                                                                      |
| **Who is responsible for the network**                      | Managed by Aptos Team.                                                                                 | Deployed, managed and upgraded by you.                                                                       | Aptos Incentivized Testnet (AIT) is managed by Aptos and the community.                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Purpose of the network**                                  | The devnet is built to experiment with new ideas, improve performance and enhance the user experience. | The local testnet is for your development purposes and runs on your local computer.                          | For executing the Aptos Incentivized Testnet programs for the community.                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Network status**                                          | Mostly live, with brief interruptions during regular updates.                                          | On your local computer.                                                                                      | **Live only during Incentivized Testnet drives**.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Type of nodes** (also see the row **Network runs where**) | Validators and FullNodes.                                                                              | Validators and FullNodes.                                                                                    | Validators and FullNodes.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **How to connect to the network**                           | <ul><li> You can transact directly with devnet without a local testnet. See, for example, [Your first transaction](../tutorials/first-transaction.md).</li><li> You can run FullNodes locally on your computer and synchronize with devnet. See [Run a FullNode](/nodes/full-node/fullnode-for-devnet).</li></ul>                                                                              | You can start a Validator and FullNode locally and connect with your local testnet for development purposes. | You must start both a local AIT Validator node locally to connect to the AIT-1. Optionally, FullNodes can also be run locally and connected to AIT-1.                                                                           |
| **What not to do**                                          | Do not attempt to sync your local AIT FullNode or AIT Validator node with devnet.                      | Do not attempt to sync your local testnet Validator node with Aptos Incentivized Testnet.                    | Make sure you deploy your local AIT FullNode and AIT Validator node in the test mode, and follow the instructions in [Deploying for Aptos Incentivized Testnet](validator-node/intro#deploying-for-aptos-incentivized-testnet). |
