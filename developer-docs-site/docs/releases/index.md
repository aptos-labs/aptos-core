# Latest Aptos Releases

Each Aptos release can be found on the GitHub site for [Aptos-core releases](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/releases). Each release is mirrored by the following git branches:

* [Latest Mainnet Release](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/tree/mainnet)
* [Latest Testnet Release](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/tree/testnet)
* [Latest Devnet Release](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/tree/devnet)

Aptos typically conducts multiple devnet releases for each testnet and mainnet release. Hence, devnet releases use commit hashes for tracking rather than version numbers. Testnet and mainnet releases usually have a one-to-one correlation, meaning each testnet release rolls into mainnet.

Hot fixes are exceptions that may occur in mainnet to address urgent issues in production. See the [Aptos Release Process](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/RELEASE.md) for more details.
