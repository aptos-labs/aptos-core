# Latest Aptos Releases

This section contains details for the latest [Aptos releases](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/releases). See the sub-pages for the latest release for each network:

* [Latest Mainnet Release](./mainnet-release.md)
* [Latest Testnet Release](./testnet-release.md)
* [Latest Devnet Release](./devnet-release.md)

Aptos typically conducts multiple devnet releases for each testnet and mainnet release. Hence, devnet releases use commit hashes for tracking rather than version numbers. Testnet and mainnet releases usually have a one-to-one correlation, meaning each testnet release rolls into mainnet.

Hot fixes are exceptions that may occur in mainnet to address urgent issues in production. See the [Aptos Release Process](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/blob/main/RELEASE.md) for more details.
