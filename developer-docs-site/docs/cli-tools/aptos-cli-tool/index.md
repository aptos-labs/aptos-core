# Install Aptos CLI

The Aptos command line interface (CLI) helps you develop apps, debug issues, and operate nodes. See [Use Aptos CLI for Configuration](./use-aptos-cli.md) for all possible uses.

You may install the Aptos CLI in any of these ways:

* [Download Aptos CLI binaries](./install-aptos-cli.md) - Ensures you get a stable version of the Aptos CLI built on a regular cadence from the `main` upstream development branch.
* [Build Aptos CLI with brew](../build-from-brew.md) - Simplifies install on Linux and macOS machines by using the `brew` CLI to manage packages. Homebrew also offers limited support for [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux).
* [Build Aptos CLI from source code](../build-from-source.md) - Allows you to build from any of the Aptos branches, including `devnet`, `testnet`, `mainnet`, and the latest code in the `main` upstream development branch.
