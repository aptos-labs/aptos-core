# Move Prover

The Move Prover supports formal [specification](./spec-lang.md) and [verification](./prover-guide.md) of Move code. The Move Prover can automatically validate logical properties of Move smart contracts while offering a user experience similar to a type checker or linter.

The Move Prover exists to make contracts more *trustworthy*; it:

- Protects massive assets managed by the Aptos blockchain from smart contract bugs
- Protects against well-resourced adversaries
- Anticipates justified regulator scrutiny and compliance requirements
- Allows domain experts with a mathematical background, but not necessarily a software engineering background, to understand what smart contracts do

For more information, refer to the documentation:

- [Installation](../../tools/aptos-cli/install-cli/install-move-prover.md) 
- [Move Prover User Guide](prover-guide.md)
