# Install Aptos Fullnodes

This section explains how to install a public fullnode to connect to the Aptos networks. 

:::tip Default connection to devnet
If you follow the default setup in this document, then your public fullnode will be connected to the Aptos devnet with a REST endpoint accessible on your computer at localhost:8080. 

To connect to a different Aptos network, such as devnet or testnet, make sure you have the correct version of:
- Docker image tag (e.g. devnet, testnet)
- Source code branch (if you build the binary directly) 

You can find genesis and waypoint here ➜ https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-networks.
