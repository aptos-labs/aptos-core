# Aptos Developer Network

Welcome! Aptos is building a Layer 1 for everyone. Here in our documentation you can explore tutorials and technical concepts for the Aptos Network.

## 🤔 Got a question?

Join our [Discord][discord] to speak with our developers and hop into the Aptos community. It's the best way to keep up to date with news and developments in the Aptos universe. Be sure to check pinned messages in the channels - this is where we like to keep topic-specific links, events, and more.

Or even if you just want to stop by to say gm! 🌅 : there's a little something for everyone!

Make sure to fill out our [Developer Network Typeform][typeform] to receive access!

### 🤿 Want to dive in?

Start with the basics, such as how [Accounts](/basics/basics-accounts) work. Want something a bit more interactive? You can dive right in to our [tutorials](/tutorials/getting-started).

Or you can go straight to the [source](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core) (ha ha) and help us build the Layer 1 for everyone.

:::info ✨ Testnet Resets ✨

### ⚔️ Be safe out there

It's dangerous to go alone. Please remember, our community managers will never message or DM you first, and they will never ask you to send them money or share any sensitive, private, or personal information. If this happens to you, please report it to us in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/zTDYBEud7U), or by sending an email to [security@aptoslabs.com](mailto:security@aptoslabs.com)

### 💪 Join our crew

Want to join a great team working on amazing world-scale problems? Take a look at our [active roles](https://boards.greenhouse.io/aptoslabs), and come build with us!

### 👾 Have fun!

We're excited to have you here and look forward to getting to know you. We are all in this together 🦍
