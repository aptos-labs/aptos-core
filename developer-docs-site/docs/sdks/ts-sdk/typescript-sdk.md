# Typescript SDK

Aptos provides an official Typescript SDK. This section describes how to install and use it.

## Installing Typescript SDK

1. Make sure you [downloaded the latest precompiled binary for the Aptos CLI](/cli-tools/aptos-cli-tool/install-aptos-cli/#download-precompiled-binary).
2. On a terminal run the below command to install the Typescript SDK from [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aptos):
   ```bash
   npm -i aptos
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   yarn add aptos
   ```
   
   :::tip
   The above command installs the TS SDK and should not be confused as installing the Aptos CLI.

## Using Typescript SDK

See the [Developer Tutorials](/tutorials/index.md) for code examples showing how to use the Typescript SDK.
