# Aptos Rust SDK

### Installing Rust SDK

Aptos provides an official Rust SDK. To use the Rust SDK, add the following dependency on the git repo directly, like this:

```toml
aptos-sdk = { git = "https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core", branch = "devnet" }
```

The source code for the official Rust SDK is available in the [aptos-core GitHub repository](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/tree/main/sdk).

## Using Rust SDK

See the [Developer Tutorials](/tutorials/index.md) for code examples showing how to use the Rust SDK.
