# Aptos Community Highlights

This page shines a light on exemplary contributions from our community members. These enhancements can be documentation, features, or both. This builds upon the standalone [ecosystem projects](https://github.com/aptos-foundation/ecosystem-projects) listed in GitHub.

To add your own contribution here, first submit a new page to Aptos.dev or a product feature in the [`aptos-core`](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core) repository. The source materials for both live in GitHub too. See [Contribute](../index) for ways to make updates.
