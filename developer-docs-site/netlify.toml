[build]
# Ignore the build when nothing in the docs directory has changed.
# This is a workaround/override for netlify's default ignore behaviour which 
# only checks whether are any changes between the last builds (on the same branch)
# which leads it to skipping the deploy preview on some commits as observed by @rajkaramchedu in the past.
# What we really want is to check whether there are any changes in the current branch compared to main
# and this command achieves that.
# More details can be found here https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/ignore-builds/ 
# and here https://answers.netlify.com/t/builds-cancelled-for-a-new-branch-due-to-no-content-change/17169/4
ignore = "if [ \"$PULL_REQUEST\" == \"true\" ]; then git diff --quiet main $COMMIT_REF . ; else git diff --quiet $CACHED_COMMIT_REF $COMMIT_REF; fi"
