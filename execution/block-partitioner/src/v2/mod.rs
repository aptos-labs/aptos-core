/// A block partitioner that partitions a block into multiple transaction chunks.
/// On a high level, the partitioning process is as follows:
/// ```plaintext
/// 1. A block is partitioned into equally sized transaction chunks and sent to each shard.
///
///    Block:
///
///    T1 {write set: A, B}
///    T2 {write set: B, C}
///    T3 {write set: C, D}
///    T4 {write set: D, E}
///    T5 {write set: E, F}
///    T6 {write set: F, G}
///    T7 {write set: G, H}
///    T8 {write set: H, I}
///    T9 {write set: I, J}
///
/// 2. Discard a bunch of transactions from the chunks and create new chunks so that
///    there is no cross-shard dependency between transactions in a chunk.
///   2.1 Following information is passed to each shard:
///      - candidate transaction chunks to be partitioned
///      - previously frozen transaction chunks (if any)
///      - read-write set index mapping from previous iteration (if any) - this contains the maximum absolute index
///        of the transaction that read/wrote to a storage location indexed by the storage location.
///   2.2 Each shard creates a read-write set for all transactions in the chunk and broadcasts it to all other shards.
