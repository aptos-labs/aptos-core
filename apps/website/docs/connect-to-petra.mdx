# Connecting to <CompanyName />

To use <CompanyName /> with your dApp, your user must first install <CompanyName /> on their Chrome browser. <CompanyName /> injects an `aptos` object into the [window](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window) of any web app the user visits. 

To check if the user has installed <CompanyName />, perform the below check:

```typescript
const isPetraInstalled = window.aptos
```

<br />
If <CompanyName /> is not installed, you can prompt the user to first install <CompanyName /> and provide the below installation instructions. For example, see below:

```typescript
const getAptosWallet = () => {
    if ('aptos' in window) {
        return window.aptos;
    } else {
        window.open('https://petra.app/', `_blank`);
    }
}
```

## Installing <CompanyName /> 

To install <CompanyName /> on your Chrome browser, you can download it from the [chrome store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/petra-aptos-wallet/ejjladinnckdgjemekebdpeokbikhfci?hl=encategory=extensions).

## Connecting to <CompanyName />

After confirming that the web app has the `aptos` object, we can connect to <CompanyName /> by calling `wallet.connect()`. 

When you call `wallet.connect()`, it prompts the user to allow your web app to make additional calls to <CompanyName />, and obtains from the user basic information like the `address` and `public key`. 

See the example code below:

```typescript
const wallet = getAptosWallet();
try {
    const response = await wallet.connect();
    console.log(response); // { address: string, address: string }

    const account = await wallet.account();
    console.log(account); // { address: string, address: string }
} catch (error) {
    // { code: 4001, message: "User rejected the request."}
}
```

**NOTE**: After the user has approved the connnection for the first time, the web app's domain will be remembered for the future sessions. 

## Disconnecting <CompanyName />

When you want the web app to forget about the connection status with <CompanyName />, you can do this by calling `wallet.disconnect()` in your web app. See below:

```typescript
await wallet.disconnect();
```

**NOTE**: After disconnecting, the web app must reconnect to <CompanyName /> to make requests.
