# Signing Messages

A web app can also request the user to sign a message, by using <CompanyName /> API `wallet.signMessage(payload: SignMessagePayload)`. 

Web apps can write their own message, then send it to <CompanyName />. The user will be prompted to sign that message, and then the signed message will be returned to the web app.

The following is provided for additional security.

- `signMessage(payload: SignMessagePayload)` prompts the user with the `payload.message` to be signed
    - returns `Promise<SignMessageResponse>`

Types:
```typescript
export interface SignMessagePayload {
  address?: boolean; // Should we include the address of the account in the message
  application?: boolean; // Should we include the domain of the dapp
  chainId?: boolean; // Should we include the current chain id the wallet is connected to
  message: string; // The message to be signed and displayed to the user
  nonce: string; // A nonce the dapp should generate
}

export interface SignMessageResponse {
  address: string;
  application: string;
  chainId: number;
  fullMessage: string; // The message that was generated to sign
  message: string; // The message passed in by the user
  nonce: string,
  prefix: string, // Should always be APTOS
  signature: string; // The signed full message
}
```

### Example message and response
`signMessage({nonce: 1234034, message: "Welcome to dapp!" })`

This would generate the `fullMessage` to be signed and returned as the `signature`:
``` typescript
APTOS
nonce: 1234034
message: Welcome to dapp!
```

## Verifying a signature
The most common usecase for signing a message is to verify ownership of a private.

```typescript
import nacl from 'tweetnacl';

const wallet = getAptosWallet(); // see "Connecting"
const message = "hello";
const nonce = "random_string"

try {
  const response = await window.aptos.signMessage({
    message,
    nonce,
  });
  const { publicKey } = await wallet.account();
  // Remove the 0x prefix
  const key = publicKey!.slice(2, 66);
  const verified = nacl.sign.detached.verify(Buffer.from(response.fullMessage), 
                                             Buffer.from(response.signature, 'hex'), 
                                             Buffer.from(key, 'hex'));
  console.log(verified);
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error);
}
```
