# Since in CI and for production we usually only build the entire workspace, some these undeclared features may not appear immediately.

# Example usage:
# $ ./scripts/cargo_update_outdated.sh
# $ git commit --all -m "Update dependencies"

# When building in test mode, we pass in the name of a non-existent
# test to prevent the tests from actually running. We just want to
# see if the packages can build.
