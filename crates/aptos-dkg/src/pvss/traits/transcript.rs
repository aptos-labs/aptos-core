//! # Traits for authenticated PVSS transcripts
//!
//! ## `InputSecret`, `DealtSecretKey` and `DealtPublicKey`
//!
//! The PVSS dealer picks a uniform *input secret* (`InputSecret`), inputs it into the PVSS dealing
//! algorithm, which deals a *dealt secret key* (`DealtSecretKey`) such that any $t$ or more subset
//! of the $n$ players can reconstruct this *dealt secret key*. Furthermore, the dealing algorithm
//! outputs to every player the *dealt public key* (`DealtPublicKey`) associated with this secret-shared
//! *dealt secret key*!
//!
//! In some PVSS protocols, the *dealt secret key* (e.g., $h_1^a\in G_1$) is a one-way function of the
//! *input secret* $a\in F$. As a result, such protocols only allows for the reconstruction of the
//! *dealt secret*, while the *input secret* cannot be reconstructed efficiently (in polynomial time).
//!
//! ## `EncryptPubKey` and `DecryptPrivKey` traits
//!
//! In a PVSS protocol, the PVSS transcript typically *encrypts* for each player their *dealt secret
//! keys share*. As a result, each player must pick an encryption key-pair: a private *decryption
//! key* (`DecryptPrivKey`) and its associated public *encryption key* (`EncryptPubKey`).
//! The dealer is assumed to have received all player's public encryption keys. This way, the dealer
//! can encrypt the shares for each player in the transcript.
//!
//! ## `DealtSecretShare` and `DealtPubKeyShare`
//!
//! The dealing algorithm outputs a *transcript* which encrypts, for each player $i$, its *share* of
//! the *dealt secret key*. We refer to this as a *dealt secret key share* (`DealtSecretKeyShare`) for
//! player $i$. Furthermore, the transcript also exposes an associated *dealt public key share*
//! (`DealtPubKeyShare`) for each *dealt secret key share*, which will be useful for efficiently
//! implementing threshold verifiable random functions.
//!
//! ## `SigningSecretKey` and `SigningPubKey`
//!
//! When using the PVSS protocol to build a $t$-out-of-$n$ distributed key generation (DKG) protocol,
//! it is necessary for each DKG player to sign their PVSS transcript so as to authenticate that
//! they contributed to the final DKG secret.
//!
//! To prevent replay of signed PVSS transcripts inside higher-level protocols, the PVSS dealer can
//! include some auxiliary data to compute the signature over too.
//!
//! ## A note on `aptos-crypto` traits
//!
//! We do not implement the `PublicKey` and `PrivateKey` traits from `aptos-crypto` for our PVSS
//! `DealtSecretKey[Share]` and `DealtPublicKey[Share]` structs because those traits (wrongly) assume
//! that one can always derive a public key from a secret key, which in our PVSS construction's case
//! does not hold.
