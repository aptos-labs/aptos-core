## Rosetta CLI

The Rosetta CLI is used for testing and is not used for any production use case.  The CLI uses the same client as the end-to-end tests to ensure consistency but with the caveat that it will panic for cases that aren't expected.

The intent of this CLI is to let developers that know about the Velor ecosystem simply call Rosetta APIs while actively developing on [Rosetta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_(software).

You can get more help about the commands with `velor-rosetta-cli --help`
