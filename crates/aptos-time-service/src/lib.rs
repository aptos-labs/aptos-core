/// `TimeService` abstracts all time-related operations in one place that can be
/// easily mocked-out and controlled in tests or delegated to the actual
/// underlying runtime (usually tokio). It's provided as an enum so we don't have
/// to infect everything with a generic tag.
///
/// `TimeService` is async-focused: the `sleep`, `interval`, and `timeout` methods
/// all return `Future`s and `Stream`s. That said, `TimeService` supports non-async
/// clients as well; simply use the `sleep_blocking` method instead of `sleep`.
/// Note that the blocking call will actually block the current thread until the
/// sleep time has elapsed.
///
/// `TimeService` tries to mirror the API provided by [`tokio::time`] to an
/// extent. The primary difference is that all time is expressed in relative
/// [`Duration`]s. In other words, "sleep for 5s" vs "sleep until unix time
/// 1607734460". Absolute time is provided by [`TimeService::now`] which returns
/// the current unix time.
///
/// Note: you must also include the [`TimeServiceTrait`] to use the actual
/// time-related functionality.
///
/// Note: we have to provide our own [`Timeout`] and [`Interval`] types that
/// use the [`Sleep`] future, since tokio's implementations are coupled to its
/// internal Sleep future.
///
/// Note: `TimeService`'s should be free (or very cheap) to clone and send around
/// between threads. In production (without test features), this enum is a
/// zero-sized type.
