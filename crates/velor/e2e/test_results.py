# We now define one TestResults that we'll use for every test case. This is a bit of a
# hack but it is the only way to then be able to provide a decorator that works out of
# the box. The alternative was to use a context manager and wrap every function call in
# it, but not only is that more verbose, but you'd have to provide the name of each test
# case manually to the context manager, whereas with this approach the name can be
# inferred from the function being decorated directly.

# Then we define an instance of the decorator that uses that TestResults instance.
