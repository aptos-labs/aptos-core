//! This crate is designed to help with tracking events and state that might be speculative in
//! nature due to speculative execution of transactions (e.g. by BlockSTM parallel executor, but
//! also in any other context). The idea is that a transaction may be speculative executed, but
//! then the speculative execution might be invalidated and discarded, possibly triggering
//! another re-execution. In this case, it is convenient to buffer certain state and events and
//! also discard them, while having a way to flush in case the execution is actually finalized.
//! All components here can (and are intended to) be used in a concurrent fashion.
//!
//! An important feature is that flush for events happens asynchronously (and in parallel via
//! rayon global pool), and a number of optimizations ensures that the operations on the critical
//! path do not introduce too much overhead (e.g. clearing, initialization).
//!
//! As far as the state is concerned, the crate currently just implements a SpeculativeCounter.
//! In the future, we could easily implement a structure similar to SpeculativeEvents to
//! keep track of any speculative state, where a trait could allow updating it (running state).
//!
//! An example of using the crate for speculative logging can be founds in tests/logging.rs

// Suppress incorrect warning, as without mut the take_counts method stops compiling.
