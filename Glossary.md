## Address
 
Address or account address refers to a specific destination on the Aptos network. Address dictates the destination and source of a specific amount of assets exchanged by two parties on the blockchain. An Aptos address is a 64-character hex string, and sometimes it can be shortened by stripping leading 0s and adding a 0x. This makes a hex-encoded 32 byte Aptos account address. 

## ANS

Aptos Name Service (ANS) is a decentralized naming address service for the Aptos blockchain. An Aptos name is a human-readable .apt domain name that is used in place of a public key, for example *love.apt*. This service also allows users to register subdomain names in addition to the registered domain. The ANS platform is built by the Aptos labs. Find out more at: https://www.aptosnames.com/ 

## API

Application Programming Interface (API) is a set of protocols and tools that allow users to interact with Aptos blockchain nodes and client networks by means of external applications.

## APT

Aptos token (APT) is the Aptos blockchain native token used for paying network and transaction fees on the network.

## Aptos

Aptos is a Layer 1 blockchain for everyone. It uses the Move programming language. Its mainnet was launched on the 12th of October 2022 to redefine of the Web3 user experience. Aptos blockchain is dedicated to creating better user experiences through increased speed, security, scalability, reliability and usability with low transaction costs.  The word “Aptos" means "The People" in the Ohlone language.

## Aptos ecosystem

Aptos ecosystem refers to various components of the Aptos blockchain network and their interactions.  It involves the community, community-driven projects, and events.

## Aptos Explorer

Aptos Explorer is a product that helps users to examine in detail the activities on the blockchain, which include account information, validators, and transactions. This tool help users to be certain of the work they do using Aptos wallets as well as other areas in the blockchain. https://aptos.dev/guides/use-aptos-explorer/

## CLI

Command line interface (CLI) is an Aptos tool for developing on the Aptos blockchain, for node operations and debugging. https://aptos.dev/cli-tools/aptos-cli-tool/use-aptos-cli/

## Client

Client is a software that receives information from the blockchain and manage transactions. Clients interact with the blockchain through the Aptos nodes.

## Code lab

Code labs enable the use of Aptos CLI in minting non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in Aptos in order for users to have the details of the process works and employ related functions in their code. If a user have necessary funds in account, such user can follow the same steps used in devnet for mainnet, even though codelab is expected to be used on the devnet.

## Consensus

Consensus is an integral part of a validator. Consensus component is accountable for achieving security, trust, and agreement among all validators on the Aptos blockchain.

## Dapps

Decentralized applications (Dapps) are programs or digital applications that run on the Aptos blockchain autonomously. Smart contracts are commonly used in achieving this.

## Devnet

Aptos devnet is the network by which developers are given the opportunity to test given protocols. It is similar to testnet as it operates independently of the mainnet.

## Execution

Execution in the Aptos blockchain is a Aptos node component that manages the block of transactions. Execution component stores successful transactions.

## Faucet

Faucet enables the creation of no real-world value Aptos currency and it is meant to be used by Aptos devnet and testnet. Faucet is a service that ensures minting of Aptos coins for the devnet and testnet. 

## Fullnodes

Fullnodes are clients that ensure data are stored up-to-date on the network. They replicate blockchain state and transaction from other fullnodes and validator nodes.

## Indexer

Indexer is the component of the explorer that retrieves, processes, and efficiently stores raw data in the database to provide speedy access to the Aptos blockchain data.

## Mainnet

Mainnet refers to a working, fully-operational blockchain. A mainnet network has been fully deployed and performs the functionality of transferring digital currency from a sender to a recipient. 

## Module

Module, in the move, may either be a program or library that can create, transfer, or store assets.

## Move

Move is a safe and secure programming language for Web3 that emphasizes access control and scarcity. It is the programming language used to build the Aptos blockchain. You can read more about it here https://aptos.dev/guides/move-guides/move-on-aptos/

## MoveVM 

Move Virtual Machine (MoveVM) processes each validator node that translates transactions along with the current blockchain ledger state as input to produce a changeset or storage delta as output.

## Nodes

Nodes are components of the Aptos networks that track the state of the Aptos blockchain.

## Nonce

Nonce is a four-byte number encryption used on authentication protocols and cryptographic hash functions. And it can only be used once.

## PoS

Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is a security mechanism that serves in confirming the uniqueness and legitimacy of blockchain transaction. POS consensus mechanism is leveraged by the Aptos blockchain and this is powered by a network of validators that update the system and process transactions.

## REST API

Representational state transfer architectural style (REST) application programming interface (API) is a type of API that adjusts to the design principles of REST on the Aptos blockchain.

## RPC

Remote Procedure Call (RPC) serves as blockchain router or messanger by linking wallets, CLI, and Dapps with the Aptos blockchain.

## SDKs

Aptos software development kits (SDKs) are a set of tools that enables a developer to create a custom app that can be connected or added to another program. With the help of these tools, programmers can develop apps for a specific platform. Read more in this article. https://aptos.dev/sdks/index/

## Smart contract

Smart contract refers to a computer program that automatically and directly carries out the contract's terms.

## Testnet

Testnet describes the Aptos blockchain which is not fully functional as it is an alternative blockchain to be used for testing.

## Tokens

Tokens are digital units of value issued on a blockchain. They can be redeemed for assets or value held. They are built on existing blockchain. Tokens can be Fungible Token (FT), Non-Fungible Token (NFT), and Semi-Fungible Token (SFT).

## Validators

Aptos validators are in charge of verifying transactions.

## Validator nodes

Validator nodes are unique class of fullnodes that take part in consensus, specifically a Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus protocol in the Aptos. Validator selects the right transaction to be added to the Aptos blockchain as well as the order in which they are added.
