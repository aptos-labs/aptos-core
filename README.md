Aptos Core implements a decentralized, programmable database which provides a financial infrastructure that can empower billions of people.

## Note to Developers
* Aptos Core is a prototype.
* The APIs are constantly evolving and designed to demonstrate types of functionality. Expect substantial changes before the release.
* We’ve launched a testnet that is a live demonstration of an early prototype of the Aptos Blockchain software.
